Manipulation.-Print the paper a trifle 
i „™ than for the ordinary method ot 
fSI nine Kace the print face up on 
f ; ece P ofclein glass (should the print 
JuS so that it is unmanageable, moisten 
X Aass with glycerine), and, with the 
loatclmersiat brush, thinly coat the 
entire print with pure glycerine, blotting 
same off in 3 or 4 seconds; then recoat 
Sore thickly such portions as are desired 
Specially restrained, or the details 
partly or entirely eliminated Now 
Ush or paint such portion of the print 
as is first desired with solution of 1 part 
glycerine and 4 parts normal developer 
blotting the portion being developed 
from time to time to avoid developing 
too far. Full strength developer (with- 
out glycerine) is employed where a pro- 
nounced or deep shade is wanted. 

When any part of the print has reached 
the full development desired, blot that 
portion carefully with the blotter and 
coat with pure glycerine. 

A brown effect may be obtained by 
using saturated solution of mercury in 
the developer (1 part mercury to 8 parts 
developer). By the use of diluted mer- 
cury the "flesh tones" are produced m 
portraits, etc. 

"When print has reached complete 
development, place in hydrochloric 
(muriatic) acid and wash as usual 



freshly prepared solution, and colder 
tones still if the developing solution be 
faintly acidified. The repeated heating 
of the solution of the neutral salt ap- 
parently has the effect of rendering the 
bath slightly alkaline by the conversion 
of a minute proportion of the oxalate into 
potassium carbonate. If this be the 
case, it allows a little latitude in choice 
of tone which may be useful. Some 
photographers recommend the use of 
potassium phosphate with the neutral 
oxalate, stating that the solution should 
be rendered acid by the addition of a 
small proportion of oxalic acid. "When 
the potassium phosphate was first 
recommended for this purpose, probably 
the acid salt, KH s P0 4 , was intended, by 
the use of which cold steely black tones 
were .obtained. The use of the oxalic 
acid with the ordinary phosphate K s HPO«, 
is probably intended to produce the same 
result. 

THE CARBON PROCESS. 

The paper used is coated on on 
surface with a mixture of gelatin an 
some pigment (the color of which de 
pends upon the color the required prm 
is to be), and then allowed to dry.. When 
required for printing it is sensitized by 
floating upon a solution of bichromate of 
potassium, and then again drying, in the 
Sark this time. The process is based 
upon the action of light upon this film of 
cfromatized gelatin; wherever the hgh 
reaches, the gelatin is rendered msol 
ii hie even in hot water. 

The paper is exposed in the usual way.

Eastman's Sepia Paper.— This paper 
is about 3 times as rapid as blue paper. 
It should be under rather than over 
printed, and is developed by washing in 
plain water. After 2 or 3 changes of 
water fix 5 minutes in a solution of hypo 
m grains to the ounce of water), and 
afterwards wash thoroughly. 

Short fixing gives red tones. Longer 
fixing produces a brown tone. 

Development of Platinum Prints. — 
In the development of platinotype prints 
by the hot bath process, distinctly warmer 
tones are obtained by using a bath 
which has been several times heated,

K side of the original has become the 
left, and vice versa. 

If the picture be finished m this con- 
dition, it is said to have been done by the 
single transfer method. In some in- 
stances this reversal would be of no con- 
sequence, such as some portraits, but 
with views which are known this would 
never do. In order to remedy this state 
of affairs, the picture is transferred once 
more, by pressing, while wet, upon an- 
other support, and allowed to dry upon 
it; wheu separated, the picture remains 
upon the latter support, and is in its 
right position. This is what is known 
as the double transfer method. When 
the double transfer method is used, the 
first support consists of a specially pre- 
pared support, which has been waxed in 
order to prevent the pictures from ad- 
hering permanently to it; this is then 
known as a temporary support. The 
paper upon which the print is finally 
received is prepared witn a coating of 
gelatin, and is known as the final sup-

This is controlled also, to some extent h 
the subject summer sunshine requital 
a more vigorous rendering than hazf 
autumn effects, and herein each indi- 
vidual must decide for himself what i 
most necessary to give the correct por- 
trayal of the subject. It is a good idea 
to procure a slide, as near technically 
perfect as possible, from some slide- 
making friend, or dealer, to use it as a 
standard, and to make slide after slide 
from the same negative until a satis- 
factory result is reached. 

A black tone of good quality is usu- 
ally satisfactory for most slides, but it is 
very agreeable to see interspersed a va- 
riety of tone, and beautiful slides can be 
made, where the subject warrants, in 
blue, brown, purple, and even red and 
green, by varying the exposure and de- 
velopment and by using gold or uranium 
toning baths and other solutions for that 
purpose, the formulas and materials for 
which are easily obtainable from the 
magazines and from stock dealers, re- 
spectively. 

It must be understood, however, that 
these toning solutions generally act as 
intensifies, and that if toning is contem- 
plated, it should be borne in mind at the 
time of developing the slide, so that it 
may not finally appear too dense, los- 
ing will improve otherwise weak slmes, 
but will not help under-exposed ones, a 
its tendency will be in such case to in- 
crease the contrast, which in such sJi 
is already too great. Another me P% 
of getting a fine quality of slides is 
make rather strong exposures to « 
develop, and then to reduce with 
phate of ammonium. , . fte

a size to fill it out properly, providing, 
however for sufficient foreground and a 
n?oper sky line. Landscapes and marine 
views generally can be made to fill out 
Se fun length of mat opening, which, 
however, should not exceed 4 inches, 
Sd may be of any height to suit the sub- 
iect up to 2J inches. , 
The subject should be well centered 
on the plate and the part intended to be 
shown as the picture should be well 
within the size of the mat opening de- 
cided upon, so that with a slight varia- 
tion of the placing of the mat no part of 
the picture will be cut off by the carrier 
in the stereopticon. The horizon line m 
a landscape, and more particularly in a 
marine view, should always be m proper 
position, either below or above the center 
line of the slide, as may suit the subject, 
but should never divide the picture m the 
middle and should not appear to be run- 
ning either up or down hill. And the ver- 
tical lines in the pictures should not be 
leaning, but should run parallel with the 
side lines of the mat; this refers espe- 
cially to the vertical lines in architecture, 
except, however, the Tower of Pisa and 
kindred subjects, which should in every 
case be shown with their natural inclina- 
tions 



As to time of exposure, very little can 
be said. That varies with the different 
makes of plates, with the quality of the 
light, and the nature and density of 
each individual negative. Therefore 
every one must be a judge unto himselt 
and make as good a guess as he can for 
the first trial from each negative and 
gauge further exposures from the results 
thus obtained; but this much may be 
said, that a negative strong in contrast 



should be given a long exposure, close 
to the light, if artificial light is used, or in 
strong daylight, and developed with a 
weak or very much diluted developer to 
make a soft slide with full tone values. 
And a flat, weak negative will yield bet- 
ter results if exposed farther from the 
light or to a weaker light, and developed 
by a normal or more aggressive de- 
veloper. Over exposure and under ex- 
posure show the same results in slide 
plates as in negative plates, and the treat- 
ment should be similar in both kinds of 
plates except that, perhaps, in cases of 
under exposure of slide plates, the better 
plan would be to cast them aside and 
make them over, as very little can be done 
with them. For getting bright and 
clear effects it is now well understood 
that better and more satisfactory results 
are obtained by backing the slide plates 
as well as by backing negative plates. 
This is accomplished by coating the back 
or glass side of the plate with the follow- 
ing mixture: 

Gum arable Jounce 

Caramel 1 ounce 

Burnt sienna 2 ounces 

Alcohol 2 ounces 

Mix and apply with small sponge or 
wad of absorbent cotton. 

It should coat thin and smooth and 
dry hard enough so it will not rub off 
when handled. If the plates are put into 
a lieht-proof grooved box as last as 
backed they can be used about half an 
houf after being coated. Before devel- 
oping thYs backing should be removed; 
SE£ Tis best done by first wetting the

HOW TO UTILIZE WASTE MA- 
TERIAL. 

Undoubtedly spoiled negatives form 
the greatest waste. The uses to which a 
ruined negative may be put arc mani- 
fold. Cut down to 8£ inches square and 
the films cleaned off, they make excellent 
cover glasses for lantern slides. An- 
other use for them in the same popular 
branch of photography is the following; 
if, during development, you see that 
your negative JS spoiled through uneven 
density, over exposure, or what not ex-

Users of pyro, instead of throwing tv 
old developer away, should keep som P 
it and allow it to oxidize. A thin a 
tive, if immersed_ in this for a few m^* 
utes, will be stained a deep vellow all 
over, and its printing quality will b 
much improved. e 
Old hypo baths should be saved, and 
when a sufficient quantity of silver is 
thought to be in solution, reduced to 
recover the metal. 

Printing paper of any sort is another 
great source of waste, especially to the 
inexperienced photographer. Prints are 
too dark or not dark enough success- 
fully to undergo the subsequent opera- 
tions. Spoiled material of this kind, 
however, is not without its uses in 
photography. Those who swear by the 
'combined bath," will find that scraps of 
printing-out paper, or any silver paper, 
are necessary to start the toning action. 

Spoiled mat surface, printing -out 
paper, bromide paper, or platinotype 
should be allowed to blacken all over. 
Here we have a dead-black surface use- 
ful for many purposes. A leak in the 
bellows when out in the field may be 
repaired temporarily by moistening a 
piece of mat printing-out. paper and stick- 
ing it on the leak; the gelatin will cause 
it to adhere. These papers may also 
be used to back plates, platinotypes, of 
course, requiring some adhesive mixture 
to make them slick. 

In every photographer's possession 
there will be found a small percentage ot 
stained prints. Instead of throwing 
these away, they may often be turned to 
good account in the following manner. 
Take a large piece of cardboard, some 
mountant, and the prints. Now P r °^f

precipitated in the form of a reddish or 
Kackish powder is collected on a filter 
and dried in an oven with weights equal 
to its own of borax, saltpeter, and car- 
bonate of potash. The mass « after- 
wards introduced gradually into a fire- 
proof crucible and carried to a white-red 
teat in a furnace. When all the matter 
has been introduced, a stronger blast is 
given by closing the furnace, so that all 
the metal collects at the bottom of the 
crucible. On cooling, a gold ingot, 
chemically pure, will be obtained. I his 
mode of reduction is also suitab e tor 
impure chloride of gold, and for the re- 
moval of gilding, but not for solutions 
containing cyanides, which never give up 
all the gold they contain; the best means 
of treating the latter consists in evaporat- 
ing them to dryness in a cast-iron boiler, 
and in calcining the residue in an earthen 
crucible at the white red. A small 
quantity of borax or saltpeter may be 
added for facilitating the fusion, but it 
is not generally necessary. The gold 
separated collects at the bottom of the 
crucible. It is red, if saltpeter is em- 
ployed; and green, if it is borax. 

To reclaim silver place the old films, 
plates, paper, etc., in a porcelain dish, so 
arranged that they will burn readily. To 
facilitate combustion, a little kerosene or 
denatured alcohol poured over the con- 
tents will be found serviceable. 

Before blowing off the burnt paper, 
place the residue in an agateware dish, 
the bottom of which is covered with a 
solution of saltpeter and water. Place 
the whole on the fire, and heat it until 
the silver is separated as a nitrate. 

The solution being complete, add to 
the mass a little water and hydrochloric 
acid, when in a short time the serviceable 
silver chloride will be obtained. _ If the 
films should nox give up their silver as 



freely as the plates, then add a little more 
hydrochloric acid or work them up 
separately. Silver reclaimed in this way 
is eminently suitable for silver-plating 
all sorts of objects.

A Simple Emulsion for Mat or Print- 
ing-Out Paper. — One of the very best 
surfaces to work upon for coloring in 
water color is the carbon print. Apart 
from its absolute permanency as a base, 
the surface possesses the right tooth fo 
the adhering of the pigment. It is jus" 
such a surface as this that is require 
upon other prints than carbon, both fo 
finished mat surfaces and for the pur 
poses of coloring. The way to ob 
tain this surface upon almost any kin 
of paper, and to print it out so that th 
correct depth is ascertained on sigh 
will be described. Some of the crayon 
drawing papers can be utilized, as well 
as many other plain photographic papers 
that may meet the desires of the pho- 
tographer. If a glossy paper is desired, 
the emulsion should be coated on a 
baryta-coated stock. 

There will be required, in the first, 
place, 2 half-gallon stoneware crocks . 
with lids. The best shape to employ is 
a crock with the sides running straight, 
with no depressed ridge at the top. One 
of these crocks is for the preparation of 
the emulsion, the other to receive the 
emulsion when filtered. An enameled 
iron saucepan of about 2 gallons capac- 
ity will be required in which to stand 
the crock for preparing the emulsion 
and also to remelt the emulsion alter it 
has become set. The following is the 
formula for the emulsion, which must be 
prepared and mixed in the order given 
SaiFure will be impossible if these details 
nrp scrupulously attended to. 

Havm" procured 2 half-gallon stone- 
ware crocks with lids, clean them out 
"el? with hot and cold water, and place 
into one of these the following:

by covering the windows with yellow 
paper. The cover may now be placed

the following manner: 1X1 

Cut the paper into strips or sheet 
say 12 inches wide and the fulrWitth t 
the sheet. This will be, let us S S,? 
12 x 26 inches. At tach, by means of £ 
well-known photographic clips, a stri 
of wood at each end of the paper U po n 
the back. Ihree clips at each end will 
be required. Having a number of 
sheets thus prepared, the emulsion 
should be poured into a porcelain pan or 
tray, kept hot by standing within another 
tray containing hot water. The emul- 
sion tray being, say, 11 x 14 size, the 
paper now is easily coated by holding 
the clipped ends in each hand, then hold- 
ing the left end of the paper up, and the 
right-hand end lowered so that the curve 
of the paper just touches the emulsion. 
Then raise the right hand, at the same 
time lowering the left hand at the same 
rate. Then Tower the right hand, lifting 
the left. Repeat tins operation once 
more; then drain the excess of emulsion 
at one corner of the tray, say, the left- 
hand corner. Just as soon as the emul- 
sion has drained, the coated sheet of 
paper may be hung up to dry, by 1 the 
hooks attached to the clips, upon a piece 
of copper wire stretched from side to 
side of a spare closet or room that can be 
kept darkened until the paper is dry. In 
this way coat as much paper as may be 
required. When it is dry it may be 
rolled up tight or kept flat under pressure 
until needed. 

If any emulsion remains it may Jjj-j 
kept in a cool place for 2 weeks, and SW 
be good for coating. Be sure to cltun 
out all the vessels used before the e»nj 
sion sets, otherwise this will present 
difficult task, since the emulsion sets jm 
an almost insoluble condition. , 
This emulsion is so made that it ao 
?ot require to be washed. If it is 
it will become spoiled. It is easy 
make and easy to use. If it 13 d f*L 
that only sma ]] snccts of pape r are to 
coated, they may be floated on the effl" 
sion, but in this case the paper 
damp, which is easily accomplish 



witis a sheet of blotting paper, then 
raring this with two dry sheets of blot- 
pap«. Place the sheets to be 
* g * A irnon these, and place under 
C ° at de during the night. Next day 
B5 £ II be in good condition for floating. 

When the coated paper is dry it may 
, p orinted and toned just the same as any 
other printing-out paper, with any toning 
bath and fixed in hyposulphite of soda 
-f iisual Toning may be carried to a 
rich blue black, or if not earned too far 
"ill remain a beautiful sepia color. 
After well washing and drying, it will be 
nbserved that the surface corresponds 
with that of a carbon print; if the paper 
has been of a somewhat absorbent char- 
acter the surface will be entirely mat, and 
will eive an excellent tooth for coloring 
or finishing in sepia, black and white, etc. 

How to Sensitize Photographic Print- 
ing Papers. — I . — The older form of 
paper is one in which the chemicals are 
held by albumen. Silver is said to com- 
bine with this, forming an albuminate. 
Pictures printed on this would be too 
sharp in their contrasts, and conse- 
quently "hard"; this is avoided by intro- 
ducing silver chloride. 

To prepare this form of paper, beat 15 
ounces of fresh egg albumen with 5 
ounces of distilled water, dissolye in it 
300 grains of ammonium chloride, set 
aside for a time, and decant or filter. 
Suitable paper is coated with this solu- 
tion by floating, and then dried. The 
paper is "sensitized" by floating it on 
a solution of silver nitrate in distilled 
water, about 80 grains to the ounce, with 
a drop of acetic acid. The paper is 
dried as before, and is then ready for 
printing. The sensitizing must, of 
course, be done in the dark room. 

The reaction between the ammonium 
chloride present in the albumen coating 
produces a certain quantity of silver chlo- 
ride, the purpose of which is shown above. 
Of course, variations in the proportions 
of this ingredient will give different de- 
grees of softness to the picture. 

II, — The bromide and chloride papers 
which are now popular consist of the or- 
dinary photographic paper sensitized by 
means of a thin coating of bromide or 
chloride emulsion. In "Photographic 
Printing Methods," by the Rev. W. H. 
Burbank, the following method is given 
for bromide paper: 

A. — Gelatin (soft) 42£ grains 

Bromide of potassium 26 grains 
Distilled water 1 ounce 

B. — Nitrate of silver 33 J grains 

Distilled water 1 ounce 



Dissolve the bromide first, then add 
the gelatin and dissolve by gentle heat 
(95° to 100° P.), Bring tbl silver so- 
lution to the same temperature, and add 
in a small stream to the gelatin solution, 
stirring vigorously, of course in non-ac- 
tinic light. Keep the mixed emulsion at 
a temperature of 105° P, for half an hour, 
or according to the degree of sensitive- 
ness required, previously adding 1 drop 
of nitric acid to every 5 ounces of the 
emulsion. Allow it to set, squeeze 
through working canvas, and wash 8 
hours in running water. In his own 
practice he manages the washing easily 
enough by breaking the emulsion tip 
into an earthen jar filled with cold water, 
and placed in the dark room sink. A 
tall lamp chimney standing in the jar 
immediately under the tap conducts 
fresh water to the bottom of the jar, and 
keeps the finely divided emulsion in con 
stant motion; a piece of muslin, laid ove 
the top of the jar to prevent any of the 
emulsion running out, completes thi 
simple, inexpensive, but efficient wash 
ing apparatus. 

Kcxt melt the emulsion and add one 
tenth of the whole volume of glycerine 
and alcohol; the first to prevent trouble 
some cockling of the paper as it dries, th 
second to prevent air bubbles and haste 
drying. Then filter. 

With the emulsion the paper may b 
coated just as it comes from the stoc 
dealer, plain, or, better still, given 
substratum of insoluble gelatin, made a 
follows: 

Gelatin Ingrains 

Water 1 ounce 

Dissolve and filter; then add 11 drop 
of a 1 in 50 filtered chrome alum solution 
The paper is to be floated for halt ? 
minute on this solution, avoiding a 
bubbles, and then hung up to dry m 
room free from dust. The purpose o 
this substratum is to secure addition 
br liancy in the finished prints by keep 
in* the emulsion isolated from the an 
face of the paper, The paper shoul 
nnw be cut to the size desired.

Several impressions may be taken at the

For fixing, crude aniline oil is to be 
used (anilinum purum), not refined 
(purissimum), for the reason that the 
former alone contains the substances 
necessary for the operation. The re- 
produced design is placed in water for a 
few minutes, and hung up to dry.

TONING BATHS FOR PAPER. 

The chief complaints made against 
separate baths are (1) the possibility 
of double tones, and (2) that the prints 
sometimes turn yellow- and remain so, 
Such obstacles may easily be removed by 
exercising a little care. Double tones 
may be prevented by soaking the prints 
in a 10 per cent solution of common salt 
before the preliminary washing, and by 
not touching the films with the fingers; 
and the second objection could not be 
raised provided fresh solution were used, 
with no excess of sulphocyanide, if this 
be the bath adopted. 

A very satisfactory solution may he 
made as follows: 

Sodium phosphate. . . 20 grains 

Gold chloride 1 & g™ ms 

Distilled (or boiled) 

water 10 ounces 

This tones very quickly and even ]^ 
and the print will be, when fixed, exaCt ^ 
the color it is when removed from tn 
bath. Good chocolate tints may W 
obtained, turning to purple gray 011 P r 
longed immersion. ,

nipulation, the tungstate bath 
placed, the following being a g ood 
mula:

it up to the light and looking through it. 
A short immersion gives various reds, 
while prolonged toning gives soft grays. 

Results very similar to platinotype 
may be obtained with the following 
combined gold and platinum bath: 

A. — Sodium, acetate 1 drachm 

Water 4 ounces 

Gold chloride 1 grain 

B. — Chloro-platinite of po- 

tassium 1 grain 

Water 4 ounces 

Mix A and B and neutralize with nitric 
acid. (The solution will he neutral 
when it just ceases to turn red litmus 
paper blue.) 

Another toning agent is stannous 
chloride. Two or three grains of tin foil 
arc dissolved in strong hydrochloric acid 
with the aid of heat. The whole is then 
made up to about 4 ounces with water. 

Toning Baths for Silver Bromide 
Paper. — The picture, which has been 
exposed at a distance of 1$ feet for about 
8 to 10 seconds, is developed in the cus 
tomary manner and fixed in an aci 
fixing bath composed of 
Distilled water.. 1,000 cubic centimete 



We may take it that any of these sub- 
stances reduce gold trichloride, AuCl 3 to 
AuCl; this AuCl apparently acts as an 
electrolyte, from which gold is deposited 
on the silver of the image, and at the 
same time a small quantity of silver 
combines with the chlorine of the gold 
chloride thus: 

AuCl + Ag = AgCl + Au 

When toning has been completed, the 
prints are washed and placed in the fix- 
ing bath, when the sodium thiosulphate 
present dissolves any silver chloride that 
has not been affected by light. 

Besides the well-known, every-day 
tones we see, which never outstep the 
narrow range between chocolate brown 
and purple, a practically infinite variety 
of color, from chalk red to black, may be 
obtained by a little careful study of ton- 
ing baths instead of regarding them as 
mere unalterable machines. Most charm- 
ing tints are produced with platinum 
baths, a good formula being 

Strong nitric acid .... 5 drops 

Water 4 ounces 

Chloro-platinite of po- 
tassium 1 grain 

The final tone of a print cannot be 
judged from its appearance in the bath, 
but some idea of it may be got by holding

COMBINED TONING AND FIXING 
BATHS. 

The combined toning and fixing 
bath consists essentially of five pails — 
(1) water, the solvent; (2) a soluble 
salt oF gold, such as gold chloride; (3) 
tbe fixing agent, sodium thiosulphale; 
(4) a compound which will readily com- 
bine with "nascent" sulphur— i. e., sul- 
phur as it is liberated— this is usually a 
soluble lead salt, such as the arc tote or 
m rate, and (5) an auxiliary, such as a 
sulp ho cyanide.

rrk 0 nbiect of this table is to enable I 
? m ,mpulator who is about to enlarge 
any & f m K copy a ny given number of

culatioa. « 1 tJ hat the focus 

IS'l S3 that bJ is able to meas-

frt'use of the table will be seen from 
S following illustration: A photogra-

Fts si ? e and the lens he intends employ- 
■L one of 6 inches equivalent focus. 
o g L?Z therefore look for 4 on the 
SpeThoriSnSl line and for 6 in the first 
Sea column, and carry his eye to 
where these two join which wdl be at 
^ 71 The greater of these is the dw* 
fance the se/sitive plate must be from 
he center of the lens; and the lesser, the 
distance of the picture to be copied. To 
Suce a picture any given number of 
times, the same method must be fol- 
lowed- but in this case the greater num- 
ber will represent the distance between 
the lens and the picture to be copied, the 
latter that between the lens and the 
sensitive plate. This explanation wd 
be sufficient for every case of enlargement 
or reduction. , 

If the focus of the lens be IS inches, as 
this number is not in the column of focal 
lengths, look out for 6 in this column and 
multiply by 2, and so on with any other 
numbers. „ 

To make a good enlargement nve 
points should be kept constantly in view, 
viz.: , , 

L Most careful treatment of the orig- 
inal negative. 

2. Making a diapositive complete m 
all its parts. . , 

3. Scrupulous consideration of the 
size of the enlargement. 

4. Correct exposure during the proc- 
ess of enlargement. 

5. The most minute attention to the 
details of development, including the 
chemical treatment of the enlarged neg- 
ative. 

The original negative should not be 
too dense, nor, on the contrary, should it 
be too thin. If necessary, it should be 
washed off, or strengthened, as the case 
may be. Too strong a negative is usu- 
ally weakened with ammonium _ per- 
sulphate, or the fixing hypo solution 1 

nnU n i"K ' L All Tscsirito p\ 



quite sufficient. All spots, points, etc., 
should be retouched with the pencil and 
carmine. 

The diapositive should be produced by 
contact in the copying apparatus. A 
border of black paper should be used to 
Prevent the entry of light from the side. 



The correct period of exposure de- 
pends upon the thickness of the negative, 
the source of the light, its distance, etc. 
Here there is no rule, experience alone 
must teach. 

JFor developing one should use not too 
strong a developer. The mctol-soda 
developer is well suited to this work, as 
it gives especially soft lights and half 
tones. Avoid too short a- development. 
When the finger laid behind the thickest 
spot, and held toward the light, can no 
longer be detected, the negative is dense 
enough. 

The denser negatives should be ex- 
posed longer, and the development 
should be quick, while with thin, light 
negatives the reverse is true; the ex- 
posure should be briefer and the de- 
velopment long, using a strong developer, 
and if necessary with an addition of po- 
tassium bromide. 

The silver chloro-bromide diapositive 
plates, found in the shops, are totally 
unsuitcd for enlargements, as they give 
overdone, hard pictures. , 

To produce good artistic results in 
enlarging, the diapositive should be kep' 
soft, even somewhat too thin. It should 
undergo; also, a thorough retouching. 
All improvements are easily earned out 
on the smaller positive or negative pic- 
tures. Later on, .after the same have 
been enlarged, corrections are muc 
more difficult and troublesome.

Water Varnish.— It is not only in con- 
nection with its application to a wet col- 
lodion film that water varnish forms a 
valuable addition to the stock of chem- 
icals in all-round photography; it is 
almost invaluable in the case of gelatin 
as with wet collodion films. In the case 
of gelatin negatives the water varnish is 
applied in the shape of a wash directly 
after the negatives have been washed to 
free their films from all traces of hypo, 
or In other words, at that stage when the 
usual drying operation would begin. 
After the varnish has been applied the

FADED PHOTOGRAPHS AND THPTu 
TREATMENT: 

Restoring Faded Photographs. 1 _ 

As a precaution against a disaster first 
copy the old print in the same size 
Soak the faded photograph for several 
hours in clean water and, after separating 
print from mount, immerse the former ha 
nitric acid, highly dilute (1 per cent), f op 
a few minutes. Then the print is kept 
in a mercury intensifier (mercuric chlo- 
ride, ^ ounce; common salt, § ounce; hot 
water, 16 ounces, used cold), until 
bleached as much as possible. After 
half an hour's rinsing, a very weak am- 
monia solution will restore the photo- 
graph, with increased vigor, the upper 
tones being much improved, though the 
shadows will show some tendency to 
clog. The net result will be a decided 
improvement in appearance; but, at this 
stage, any similarly restored photo- 
graphs should be recopied if their im- 
portance warrants it, as mercury inten- 
sifier results are not permanent. It may 
be suggested that merely rephotograph- 
ing and printing in platinotype will 
probably answer.

the filue broken into small pieces and 
rover it with water in a clean gallipot 
large enough to allow for the subsequent 
Sing of the glue. Place on one side 
5fl tie glue lias become thoroughly 
^rmeated by the water, then pour off 
£ excess and dissolve the glue in the 
water it has absorbed by placing the 
Jampot in a vessel of hot water. The 
Solution tested with a piece of blue lit- 
mus paper will show a distinctly acid 
reaction which must be carefully neu- 
tralized by adding some solution of car- 
bonate of soda. The amount of water 
absorbed by the glue will probably be 
too little to give it the best working con- 
sistency, and, if this is the case, sufficient 
should be added to make it about the 
thickness of ordinary molasses. Care- 
ful nitration through a cambric hand- 
kerchief, and the addition of about 10 
grains of thymol, completes the prepara- 
tion of the mounting solution. As glue 
deteriorates by frequent and prolonged 
heating, it is preferable to make up a 
stock solution, from which sufficient for 
the work in hand can be taken in the 
form of jelly, melted, and used up at once. 

T!s* finished prints, dried and trimmed 
to the required size, are placed on 
the boards they are to occupy when 
mounted, and, as it is impossible to_ re- 
move a print for readjustment once it is 
laid down for final mounting, the wisest 
course is to indicate by taint pencil 
marks on the mount the exact position 
the print is to occupy; then it may be 
laid down accurately and without any 
indecision. A small gas or oil stove is 
required on the mounting table to keep 
the glue liquid, but maintaining the solu- 
tion in a constant state of ebullition 
throughout the operation is unnecessary 
and harmful to the glue; the flame 
should he regulated so that the mountant 
is kept just at the melting point. Place 
the drawing board beside the gas stove 
and with a house-painter's brush of 
good quality and size spread the glue 
oyer an area considerably exceeding the 
dimensions of the print to be mounted, 
k thin coating of glue evenly applied to 
the board is the end to aim at, to accom- 
plish 'which the brush should be worked 



m horizontal strokes, crossing these with 
others at right angles. Have at hand a 
small pile ot paper cut into pieces some- 
what larger than the print to be mounted 
(old newspaper answers admirably for 
these pieces), lay one down on the glued 
patch and press it well into contact by 
passing the elosed hand across it in aft 
directions. Raise one corner of the 
paper, and slowly but firmly strip it 
from the board. Repeat the operations 
of gluingthe board (in the same place) 
and stripping the newspaper 2 or S 
times, when a beautifully even cushion 
of glue will remain on the board. 

Mounting the prints is the next step. 
The cushion of glue obtained on the 
board has to be coated with glue for, 
say, every second print, but the amount 
applied must be as small as possible. 
After applying the glue the print is laid 
down upon it, a square of the waste 
newspaper laid over the print, which 
has then to be rubbed well into contact 
with the glue. Raise a corner of the 
print with the point of a penknife ant 
strip it from the board, as m the case of 
the newspaper. Care must be taken 
when handling the print in its glued con- 
dition to keep the fingers well beyond 
the edges of the print, in order that no 
glue may be abstracted from the edges. 
Lay the print quickly down upon it" 
mount; with a cle?n, soft linen duste

THE GUM - BICHROMATE PHOTO- 
PRINTING PROCESS. 
Gum bichromate is not a universal 
printing method. It is not suited for 
all subjects or for all negatives, but 
where there is simplicity ana breadth in 
sizes of 8£ x 6^ and upward, direct or 
enlarged prints by it have a charm al- 
together their own, and afford an oppor- 
tunity for individuality greater than any 
other method. 

While almost any kind of paper will 
do, there are certain qualities that the 
beginner at least should endeavor to 
secure. It should be tough enough to 
stand the necessary handling, which is 
considerably more than in either the 
pnnting-out or developing methods. It 
must not be so hard or smooth as to make 
coating difficult, nor so porous as to ab- 
sorb or let the coating sink in too much- 
but a few trials will show just what sur- 
face is best. Till that experience is ac- 
quired it may be said that most of What- 
man s or Michallet; 8 drawing papers, to

The quality of the gum is of l esg ■

long as it is the genuine gum arabi c -Jj 
in round, clean tears. To make VI 
solution select an 8-ounce, wide-moutUj 



bottle, of the tall rather than the S q Uat 
variety, and place in it 6 ounces of water 
Two ounces of the gum are then ' 
loosely in a piece of thin -muslin and st 
pended in the bottle so as to be about 



two-thirds covered by the water 




Solu- 



tion begins at once, as may be seen by 
the heavier liquid descending, and if 
kept at the ordinary temperature of the 
room may not be complete for 24 or even 
48 hours; but the keeping qualities of the 
solution will be greater than if the time 
had been shortened by heat. When all 
that will has been dissolved, there will 
still be a quantity of gelatinous matter i n 
the muslin, but on no account must it be 
squeezed out, as the semi-soluble matter 
thus added to the solution would be in- 
jurious. With the addition of a few 
drops of carbolic acid and a good cork 
the gum solution will keep for months. 

The selection of the pigments is not 
such a serious matter as some of the 
writers would lead us to believe. Tube 
water colors are convenient and save the 
trouble of grinding, but the cheap colors 
in powder take a better grip and give 
richer images. The best prints are made 
with mixtures of common lampblack, 
red ocher, sienna, umber, and Vandyke 
brown, the only objection to their em- 
ployment being the necessity of rather 
carefully grinding. This may be done 
with a stiffish spatula and a sheet of 
finely ground glass, the powder ^ixed 
with a little gum solution and rubbed 
with the spatula till smooth, but better 
still is a glass paper weight in the shape 
of a cone with a base of about. H inches 
in diameter, bought in the stationer s lor 
25 cents. 

The sensitizer is a 10 per cent solution 
of potassium bichromate, and ^batey^ 



be the pigment or whatever the metho 
of preparing the coating, it may I 
to keen in mind that the right ^<

strength 

or proportion, or at least a strengt 



coating that answers very well, is equa 
parts of that and the gum solution.

eD atula, as long as ayiy grittiness remains, 
Sill it is perfectly smooth, adding more 
more gum till it is like a thick cream. 
i?U then transferred to a squat teacup 
nd 1 ounce of the bichromate solution 
iridually added, working it in with one 
5 ' the brushes to perfect homogeneity. 
Of course, it will be understood that this 
mixture should be used all at once or 
™3her only as much as is to be used at 
once Should be made, as notwithstanding 
what has been said to the contrary, it .Will 
-not keep. After each operation, both or 
11 of the brushes should be thoroughly 
cleaned before putting them away. 

Not the least important are the 
brushes; one about % inches wide and 
soft for laying on the coating the other 
unless for small work, twice that breadth 
and of what is known as "badger" or a 
good imitation thereof, for softening. 
The paper can be bought in sheets of 
about 17 x m inches. Cut these in two, 
coating pieces of about 17 x 11. Xhe 
sheet is fastened to a drawing board by 
drawing pins, one at each corner. 1 he 
coating brush— of camel's hair, but it is 
said that hog's is better— is filled with 
the creamy mixture, which has been 
transferred to a saucer as more con- 
venient, and with even strokes, first one 
way and then the other, drawn all over 
the paper. It is easier to do than to de- 
scribe, but all three joints, wrist, elbow, 
and shoulder take part, and unless the 
surface of the paper is too smooth, there 
is really no difficulty to speak of. 

By the time the whole surface has been 
covered the paper will have expanded to 
an extent that makes it necessary to re- 
move three of the pins and tighten it, and 
then comes the most important and the 
only really difficult part of the work, the 
softening. The softener is held exactly 
as one holds the pen in writing, and the 
motion confined altogether to the wrist, 
bringing only the points of the hair in 
contact with the coating, more like stip- 
pling than painting. 

If much cf the coating has been laid 
on, and too much is less of an evil than 
too little, the softener will p soon have 
taken up so much as to require washing. 
This is done at the tap, drying on a soft 
cloth, and repeat the operation, the 
strokes or touches gradually becoming 
hghter and lighter, till the surface is as 
smooth and free from markings as if it 
had been floated. 

Just how thick the coating should be is 
most easily learned by experience, but as, 
unlike ordinary carbon, development 
begins from the exposed surface, it must 
he as deep; that is, as dark on the paper 



as the deepest shadow on the intended 
print, and it should not be deeper. 

While it is true that the bichromate 
colloid is not sensitive while wet, the 
coating is best done in subdued light, 
indeed, generally at night. Hang the 
sheets to dry in the dark room. 

Exposure should be made with some 
form of actino-meter. 

Development may be conducted in 
various ways, and is modified according 
to the extent of the exposure. Float the 
exposed sheet on water at the ordinary 
temperature from the tap. The expo- 
sure should admit of complete, or nearly 
complete, development in that position 
in from 5 to 10 minutes; although it 
should not generally be allowed to go so 
far. By turning up a corner from time 
to time'one may see how it goes, and at 
the suitable stage depending on what one 
really wants to do, the otherwise plain 
outcome of the negative is modified, 
gently withdrawn from the water, and 
pinned up to dry. 

The modifying operation may be done 
at once, where the exposure has been 
long enough to admit it, but generally, 
and especially when it has been such as 
to admit of the best result, the image is 
too soft, too easily washed off to make it 
safe. But after having been dried and 
again moistened by immersion in water, 
the desired modification may be mad 
with safety. . 

The moistened print is now placed on 
a sheet of glass, the lower end of whic 
rests on the bottom of the developin 
tray, and supported by the left hand at 
suitable angle; or, better still, in som 
other way so as to leave both hands free 
In this position, and with water at va 
rious temperatures, camel's-hair brushe 
of various sizes, and a rubber syringe, i 
is possible to do practically anything.

W. D. Kilbey, in the American Annual 
of Photography, gives still another table 
for the exposure that should be given to 
objects in motion. 

According to his method the table is 
made out for a distance from the camera 
100 times that of the focus of the lens; 
that is for a 6-mch focus lens at 50 
feet, a 7-inch at 58 feet, an 8-inch at 67 
lOOfeet at 76 f£et " ° r a 12-inch at

To Reduce Photographs.— When onp 
wishes to copy a drawing or photograph 
he is usually at a loss to know how hv?h 
the plate will be when any particular ball 
is selected. A plan which has the merit 
of being simple and reliable has been in 
use in engravers' offices for years. 

Here are the details: 




Reducing Scale for Copying Photographs. 

Turn the drawing face down and rule 
a diagonal line from the left bottom to 
the right top corner. Then measure 
from the left, on the bottom line, the 
width required. Ride a vertical line from 
that point until it meets the diagonal. 
Rule from that point to the left, and the 
resulting figure will have the exact pro- 
portions of the reduction. If the depth 
wanted is known, and the width is re- 
quired, the former should be measured 
on the left upright line, carried to the 
diagonal, an d thence to the lower hori- 
zon. The accompanying diagram ex- 
plains the matter simply. 

COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY: 

A Three-Color Process.— Prepare 7 
solutions, 4 of which are used for color 
screens, the remaining 3 serving as dyes 
for the plates.

The screen solutions, after being fil- 
tered through paper filters into clean 
dishes, are utilized to bathe 6 clean glass 
plates previously coated with 2 per cent 
raw collodion; we require 1 plate for blue 
violet, 2 plates for red, 2 plates for yel- 
low, and 1 plate for green, which in order 
to obtain the screens are combined m 
the following way; Yellow and red 
plate, yellow and green plate. For 
special purposes the other red plate may 
be combined with the blue violet. An- 
other method of preparing the screens 
is to add the saturated solutions drop by 
drop to a mixture of Canada balsam and 
2 per cent castor oil and cement the 
glasses together. Those who consider 
the screens by the first method too trans- 
parent, coat the glass plates with a mix- 
ture of 2 to 3 per cent raw collodion and 
1 per cent color solution. Others prefer 
gelatin screens, using

This is poured over the carefully leveled 
and heated plate after having been fil- 
tered through flannel. , 
The collodion screens are cemented 
together by moistening the edges with 
Canada balsam (containing castor on) 
and pressing the plates together in a 



printing frame, sometimes also binding 
the edges with strips of Japanese paper. 

On the evening before the day of work, 
good dry plates of about 18° to 24° W. 
are dyed in the following solution:

Stock solution, No. 1 16 parts 

Distilled water 100 parts 

Alcohol 5 parts 

Nitrate of silver 

(1.500) 50 parts 

Ammonia 1-2 parts 

This bath sensitizes almost uninter- 
ruptedly to line A. The total sensi* 
tiveness is high, and the plate develops 
cleanly and fine. Blue sensitiveness is 
very much reduced, and the blue screen 
is used for exposure. As far as the 
author's recollection goes, the plate for 
the yellow color has never been color- 
sensitized, many operators using the 
commercial Vogel-Obernetter eosm sil- 
ver plates made by Perutz, of Munich; 
others again only use ordinary dry 
plates with a blue-violet _ screen. This 
is, however, a decided mistake, necessi- 
tating an immense amount of retouch 
ing, as otherwise it produces a gree 
shade on differently colored objects o 
the print. •

soft, and free from pores or weals. it- 
blocks must be firmly fixed typehigh 
otherwise they take color irregularly. A 
good printing machine is, of course, 
most essential. 

To supplement the above working 
directions: After having kept the plates 
for 3 or 3 minutes (constantly moving 
the dish) in the dyes, they are removed 
into a dish containing filtered alcohol, 
which extracts the superfluous pigment. 
Plates thus treated dry much more 
rapidly, develop cleaner, and show no 
fogging. 

Most of the above dyes may be ob- 
tained from the "Berliner Actienge- 
sellschaft fur Amlinfabrikation," the 
acridin only from the "Farbwerk Miihl- 
heim, a/Main, vorm. A. Leonhard & 
Company." 

Solution for Preparing Color Sensitive 
Plates. — H. Vollenbruch maintains that 
plates sensitized with erythrosin silver 
citrate are not only more sensitive to 
color impressions, but also have better 
keeping qualities than ordinary ery- 
throsin bathed plates. *

Finally a large bulk of water (2o C nK-

After the filtration call this Solution 
VI. This solution keeps well. The 
slight deposit formed is redissolvcd on 
shaking. 

The plates are sensitized as follows: 
The plate to be sensitized is first laid in a 
tray of distilled water for S or 3 minutes, 
then bathed in a mixture of 1 cubic cen- 
timeter ammonia for I minute and finally 
for 2 minutes in a bath composed of the 
following:

The plate is well drained and dried in 
a perfectly dark room. These plates 
keep well for several months. 

MlCROPHOTOGRAPnS. 

The instruments used are an objective 
of very short focus and a small camera 
with a movable holder. This camera 
and the original negative to be redu ? e 
are fastened to the opposite ends ot* 
long, heavy board, similar to tt« * 
rangement in use for the making ol i& 
tern slides. The camera must he 
able in the direction of the objective ft* ■» 
and the negative must be fastened i 
vertically stationary stand. It lS ,;-j e

a I the plate used for focusing To be 
SrtdL on this point, it is best to focus 
S the picture plate, inserting for this 
Rle a yellow glass between objective 
plate. If satisfactory sharpness has 
bee n obtained, the apparatus is once for 
all in order for these distances. Bromide 
nf silver gelatin plates, on account of 
their comparatively coarse gram, are not 
suitable for these small pictures, and the 
collodion process has to come to the 

rescue. . . . 

Dagron, in Pans, a prominent spe- 
cialist in this branch, gives the following 
directions : A glass plate is well rubbed on 
both sides with a mixture of 1,000 parts 
of water, 50 parts powdered chalk, and 
200 parts of alcohol, applied with a cot- 
ton tuft, after which it is gone over with 
a dry cotton tuft, and thereafter cleaned 
with a fine chamois leather. The side 
used for taking the picture is then finally 
cleaned with old collodion. The collo- 
dion must be a little thinner than ordi- 
narily used for wet plates. Dissolve 

Ether. 400 parts 

Alcohol 100 parts 

Collodion cotton 3 parts 

Iodide ammonia. . . . 4 parts 
Bromide ammonia. . 1 part 
The plate coated herewith is silvered 
m a silver bath of 7 or 8 per cent. From 
12 to 15 seconds are sufficient for this. 

The plate is then washed in a tray or 
under a faucet with distilled water, to 
liberate it from the free nitrate of silver 
and is afterwards placed upon blotting 
paper to drip off. The still moist plate 
is then coated with the albumen mixture: 

Albumen 150 cubic centimeters 

Add 

Water 15 cubic centimeters 

Iodide potassium 3 grams 

Ammonia 5 grams 

White sugar 2 grams 

Iodine, a small cake. 

With a wooden quirl this is beaten to 
snow (foam) for about 10 minutes, after 
which it must stand for 14 hours to settle. 
The albumen is poured on to the plate 
the same as collodion, and the surplus 
filtered back. After drying, the plate is 
laid for 15 seconds in a silver bath, con-

sistmg of 100 parts of water, 10 parts 
nitrate of silver, and 10 cubie centimeters 
of acetic acid. The plate is then care- 
fully washed and left to dry. If care- 
fully kept, it will retain its properties for 
years. To the second silver bath, when 
it assumes a dirty coloration, is added 25 
parts kaolin to each 100 parts, by shak- 
ing the same well, and the bath is then 
filtered, after which a little nitrate of 
silver and acetic acid is added. 

After each exposure the plate holder 
is moved a certain length, so that 10 or 
more reproductions are obtained upon 
one and the same plate. The time of 
exposure depends upon the density of 
the negative and differs according to 
light. It varies between a second and a 
minute. 

The developer is composed as follows: 

Water 100 parts 

Gallic acid 0.3 parts 

Pyro 0-1 part 

Alcohol 2.5 parts 

The exposed plate is immersed in this 
bath, and after 10 to 20 seconds, from 1 
to 2 drops of a 2 per cent nitrate of silver 
solution are added to each 100 cubic 
centimeters of the solution, whereby the 
picture becomes visible. To follow the 
process exactly, the plate has to be laid— 
in yellow light — under a weakly enlarg- 
ing microscope, and only a few drops of 
the developer are put upon the same. 
As soon as the picture has reached the 
desired strength, it is rinsed and fixed in 
a fixing soda solution, 1 to 5. Ten to 15 
seconds are sufficient generally. Finally 
it is washed well. 

After the drying of the plate the sev- 
eral small pictures are cut with a dia- 
mond and fastened to the sma 1 enlarg- 
ing lenses. For this purpose, the latter 
arl laid upon a meta plate heated [from 
underneath, a drop of Canada balsam is

II— Aluminum 4 parts

The ingredients in each case are to be 
powdered separately, and then lightly 
mixed with a wooden spatula, as the 
compound may be ignited by friction 
and burn with explosive violence. 

It is best to make only such quantity 
as may be needed for use at the time, 
which is 10 or 15 grains. 

To Prevent Smoke from Flashlight. — ■ 
Support over the point where the ignition 
is to take place a large flat pad of damp 
wool lint. This may be done by tacking 
the lint to the underside of a board sup- 
ported on legs. When ignition takes 
place the products of combustion for the 
most part will become absorbed by the 
wool. 

A Flashlight Apparatus with Smoke 
Trap.— A light box, not too large to be 
conveniently carried out into the open 
air, is the first essential, and to the open 
Jront of this grooves must be fitted in 
which grooves a lid will slide very easily 
a large sheet of millboard being con- 
venient as a sliding lid. The box%eing

INTENSIFIERS AND REDUCERS; 

Intensifier (Mercuric) with Sodi» 
Sulphite, for Gelatin Dry Plate* 
Whiten the negative in the saturate 
solution of mercuric chloride, wash and 
blacken with a solution of sulphite of 
sodium, 1 in 5. Wash well. 

The reduction is perfect, with a posi- 
tive black tone. 

Intensifier with Iodide of Mercury.-, 
Dissolve 1 drachm of bichloride of mer- 
cury in 7 ounces of water and 3 drachms 
of iodide of potassium in 3 ounces of 
water, and pour the iodide solution into 
the mercury till the red precipitate formed 
is completely dissolved. 

For use, dilute with water, flow over 
the negative till the proper density is 
reached, and wash, when the deposit will 
turn yellow. Remove the yellow color 
by flowing a 5 per cent solution of hypo 
over the plate, and give it the final wash- 
ing. 

Agfa Intensifier.— One part of agfa 
solution in 9 parts water (10 per cent 
solution). Immerse negative from 4 to 
6 minutes. 

Intensifying Negatives Without Mer- 
cury, — Dissolve 1 part of iodine and | 
parts of potassium iodide in 10 par's of 
water. When required for use, dilute 1 
part of this solution with 100 parts ot 
water. Wash the negative well and 
place in this bath, allowing it to remain 
until it has become entirely yellow, ana 
the image appears purely dark yehw ° 
a light-yellow ground. The negative 
should then be "washed in water WW

solution may be employed repeatedly if 
its strength is kept up by the addition of 
concentrated stock solution. 

Uranium Intensifier. — 
Potassium ferricya-

Uranium nitrate 48 grains 

Sodium acetate 48 grains 

Glacial acetic acid 1 ounce 

Distilled water to 10 ounces. 

Label: Poison. Immerse the well- 
washed negative till the desired intensi- 
fication is reached, rinse for 5 minutes 
and dry. This intensifier acts very 
strongly and should not therefore be 
allowed to act too long. 

MISCELLANEOUS FORMULAS: 

Renovating a Camera. — The follow- 
ing formula should be applied to the 
mahogany of the camera by means of a 
soft rag, rubbing it well in, finally polishing 
lightly with a clean soft cloth: 

Raw linseed oil 6 ounces 

White wine vinegar. . . 3 ounces 
Methylated spirit .... 3 ounces 
Butter of antimony. . . £ ounce 
Mix the oil with vinegar by degrees, 
shaking well to prevent separation after 
each addition, then add the spirit and 
antimony, and mix thoroughly. Shake 
before using. 

Exclusion of Air from Solutions. — 
Water is free from air only when it has 
been maintained for several minutes m 
bubbling ebullition. In order to keep 
out the air from the bottle, when using 
the contents, the air-pressure contriv- 
ances are very convenient; one glass 
tube reaching through the rubber stop- 
. per into the bottle to the bottom, while 
the second tube, provided with a rubber 
pressing-ball, only runs into the flask 
above. If the long bent tube is fitted 
with a rubber tube, a single pressure suf- 
fices to draw off the desired quantity of 
the developer. It is still more convenient 
to pour a thm layer of good sweet oil on 
top of the developer besides. The de- 



veloper is not injured thereby, and the 
exclusion of air is perfect. 

Bottle Wax. — Many ready-prepared 

solutions, such as developers and other 
preparations from which light has to be 
excluded, should be packed in bottles 
whose neck, after complete drying of the 
stopper, is dipped in a pot with molten 
sealing wax. A good recipe is the fol- 
lowing, pigments being added if desired: 
Tor black take: Colophony, 6 parts; 
paraffine, 3 parts. Melt together and 
add 20 parts of black. For yellow, only 
7 parts of chrome yellow. For blue, 7 
parts of ultramarine. 

Bleacbing Photographic Prints White. 

— To make a salt print, ink over it with 
waterproof ink, then bleach out white all 
but the black lines. Sensitize Clemon's 
mat surface paper on a 40-grain bath of 
nitrate of silver. After fuming and 
printing, the print is thoroughly fixed 
m hyposulphite of soda solution, and 
Avashed in running water until every 
trace of the hypo is out of the print. On 
this the permanency of the bleaching op- 
eration depends. The bleaching bath is: 
Bichloride of mercury 1 ounce 

Water 5 ounces 

Alcohol 1 ounce 

Hydrochloric acid.. .. 1 drachm 
If the drawing has been made with 
non-waterproof ink, then alcohol is sub- 
stituted for the water in the formula 
For safety, use an alcoholic solution o 
mercury. The bleaching solution i. 
poured on and off the drawing, and, wh" 
the print is bleached white, the mercury 
washed off the drawing by holding it f o 
a few moments under running water 
Photographs bleached in this way w 
keep white for years.

one corner. 

Phosphorescent Photographs. — The 
necessary chemicals belong to the class of 
phosphorescent bodies, among others, 
calcium sulphite, strontium sulphite, 
barium sulphide, calcareous spar, fluor- 
spar. These placed in the magnesium 
light or sunlight, acquire the property of 
giving forth, for a shorter or longer time, 
a light of their own. The best examples 
of these substances are the well-known 
"Balmains light colors," which yield a 
very clear and strong light after ex- 
posure. They consist of calcium sul- 
phide, 10,000 parts; bismuth oxide, 13 
parts; sodium hyposulphite, 1,000 parts. 

According to Professor Schnauss, 
plates for phosphorographs are prepared 
as follows: Dissolve 10 parts of pure 
gelatin in 50 parts of hot wa ter, add and 
dissolve 30 parts of "light" color (as 
above), and 1 part of glycerine.

Spots on Photographic Plates.— Spots 
on photographic plates may be caused 
by dust or by minute bubbles i n the 
emulsion, both of which are easily pre- 
ventable, but some spots cannot be 
ascribed to either of these causes. On 
investigating this trouble, Mumford 
found that it is due to the presence on 
the surface of the film of small colonics 
of microorganisms which, under condi- 
tions favorable to their growth, are capa- 
ble of producing large mold colonies, 
from which the organisms can easily be 
separated. Experiments were instituted 
in order to find whether these growths 
can be produced on the plate by arti- 
ficial means, by inoculating the surface 
with a fluid culture of one of these 
organisms, with affirmative results, but 
with one slight difference, namely, that 
in the inoculated film, on microscopic 
examination, no du particle was visible 
in the center of each spot, which had 
formerly been the case. As these micro- 
organisms do not exist in the air as iso- 
lated units, but travel upon small or large 
dust particles in the case under consid- 
eration, the carrying medium most 
probably is the fine impalpable dust 
from which it is practically impossible to 
free the air of a building. In order 
that these organisms may grow intP 
colonies of sufficient size Lo cause spots, 
they must be able to grow rapidly, there 
being only about 12 hours before tn 
plate is dry in which they can grow; ana 
they must also be capable of g^JJp j 
the rather high temperature of "V *' 
On testing some of the organisms cau 
ing the spots it was found that they g^^ 
best under exactly such conditions. ^ 
bacteriological examination of some 
the gelatin used in the manufacture^ 
plates, both in the raw state and in - 
form of emulsion, also revealed the ^ 
that there were numerous or £ a " t ; 0 n

To Remove Pyro Stains from the Fin- 
Js-Make a strong solution oF chlori- 
g VjA lime- dip the fingers which are 
Sained in this, and rub the stains with a 
S crystal of citric acid. Apply the 
&e solution and acid alternately until 
thf stain is removed; then rinse with 
water. 

To Remove Pyro Stain from Nega- 
tives.— Immerse in a clearing bath as 
follows: 

Protosulphate of iron . 3 ounces 

Alum } ouuce 

Citric acid 1 ounce 

Water 2° ounces 

Prevention is better than cure^ how- 
ever- therefore immerse the negatives in 
the above directly they are taken from 
the fixing bath. After clearing the neg- 
atives, they should be well washed. 



Process of Transferring Photos to 
Watch Cases and Dials.— Flow the 
photo with the solution as made below, 
let dry ten or fifteen minutes, then paste 
down on a piece of clean window glass 
using an ordinary paste. Let dry for an 
hour or dry more quickly over a lamp. 
Then with your finger, rub the back of 
the picture" from the center outward, 
using plenty of cold water. When paper 
is all off, lay the glass in hot water and 
the composition will lift from the glass. 
Put it on a piece of common paper cut 
, to the size desired and throw the circle 
tack in the water and the impression 
will float from the paper. Then cover 
the case or dial with a solution of Acacia 
and stick the picture in the case with a 
silk handkerchief and the work is done. 
Solution for flowing over photo: 

Ethyl Chloride or Sul- 
phuric Ether 1 drachm 

Collodion 1 ounce 

Venice Turpentine 

about 6 drops 

A little less turpentine will be best to 
start with and add more if the film does 
not turn white quickly when working. 
Follow the directions carefully. 



Pigments 

(See also Paints.) 
Nature, Source, and Manufacture of 
Pigments. — A pigment is a dry earthy or 
clayey substance that, when mixed with 
oil, water, etc., forms a paint. Most 
pigments are of mineral origin, but there 
are vegetable pigments, as logwood, and 
animal pigments, as cochineal. In 
modern practice the colors are produced 
mainly by dyeing certain clays, which 
excel in a large percentage of silicic acid, 
with aniline dyestuffs. The coloring 
matters best adapted for this purpose 
are those of a basic character. The col- 
ors obtained in this manner excel in a 
vivid hue, and fastness to light and water. 

Following is a general outline of their, 
manufacture: One hundred parts, by 
weight, of washed clay in paste form are 
finely suspended in 6 to 8 times the volume 
of water and acidulated with about 1J 
parts, by volume, of 5 percent hydrochlo- 
ric or acetic acid, and heated by means 
of steam almost to the boiling tempera- 
ture. There is next introduced, ac- 
cording to the shade desired, 1 to 2 parts, 
by weight, of the dyestuff, such as aura- 
min, diamond green, Victoria blue, etc., 
■with simultaneous stirring and heating, 
for 1 to 2 hours, or until a sample filtered 
off from the liquor shows no dyestuff. 
; Next the clay dyed in this manner is 
1 isolated by filtration and washed with 
hot water and dried. The colors thus 
obtained may be used as substitutes foi 
mineral colors of all description. 

The method of manufacture varies 
greatly. According to the ; Bennett and 
ILstin English patent the P^edure 
is as follows : Grind together to a paste 
n water, substances of a clayey, stony 
earthy, or vitreous nature, and certain 
Letarlic oxides, or "prepared oxides 
such as are commonly used "J the pot
