ENAMELING 



PREPARATION OF ENAMELS. 

The base of enamel is glass, colored 
different shades by the addition^ of me- 
tallic oxides mixed and melted with it. 

The oxide of cobalt produces blue; 
red is obtained by the Cassius process. 
The purple of Cassius, which is one of 
the most brilliant of colors, is used al- 
most exclusively in enameling and min- 
iature painting; it is produced by adding 
to a solution of gold chloride a solution 
of tin chloride mixed with ferric chloride 
until a green color appears. The oxide 
of iron and of copper also produces red, 
but of a less rich tone; chrome produces 
green, and manganese violet; black is 
produced by the mixture of these ox- 
ides. Antimony and arsenic also enter 
into the composition of enamels. 

Enamels are of two classes— opaque 
and transparent. The opacity is caused 
by the presence of tin. 

When the mingled glass and oxides 
have been put in the crucible, this is 
placed in the furnace, heated to a tem- 
perature of 1,832° or 2,200° F. When 
the mixture becomes fused, it is stirred 
with a metal rod. Two or three hours 
are necessary for the operation. The 
enamel is then poured into water, which 
divides it into grains, or formed into 
cakes or masses, which are left to cool. 

For applying enamels to metals, gold, 
silver, or copper, it is necessary to reduce 
them to powder, which is effected in an 
agate mortar with the aid of a pestle of 
the same material. During the opera- 
tion the enamel ought to be soaked in 
water. 

For dissolving the impurities which 
may have been formed during the work, 
a few drops of nitric acid are poured in 
immediately afterwards, well mixed, and 
then got rid of by repeated washing with 
filtered water. This should be carefully 
done, stirring the enamel powder with a 
glass rod, in order to keep the particles in 
suspension. 

The powder is allowed to repose at 
the bottom of the vessel, after making 
sure by the taste of the water that it does 
not contain any trace of acid; only then 
is the enamel ready for use. 

For enameling a jewel or other object 
it is necessary, first to heat it strongly, in 
order to burn off any fatty matter, and 
afterwards to cleanse it in a solution of 
nitric acid diluted with boiling water. 
After rinsing with pure water and wip- 
ing with a very clean cloth, it is heated 
slightly and is then ready to receive the 
enamel. 

Enamels are applied with a steel tool 
in the form of a spatula; water is the 



vehicle. When the layers of enamel have 
been apphed s the contained water is 
removed by means of a fine linen rae 
pressing slightly on the parts that hale 
received the enamel. The tissue ab- 
sorbs the water, and nothing remains on. 
the object except the enamel powder 
It is placed before the fire to remove every 
trace of moisture. Thus prepared and 
put on a fire-clap slab, it is ready for its 
passage to the heat which fixes the 
enamel. This operation is conducted in 
a furnace, with a current of air whose 
temperature is about 1,832° F. In this 
operation the fire-chamber ought not to 
contain any gas. 

Enamels are fused at a temperature 
1,292° to 1,472° F. Great attention is 
needed, for experience alone is the guide, 
and the duration of the process is quite 
short. On coming from the fire, the 
molecules composing the enamel powder 
have been fused together and present to 
the eye a vitreous surface covering the 
metal and adhering to it perfectly. Un- 
der the action of the heat the metallic 
oxides contained in the enamel have met 
the oxide of the metal and formed one 
body with it, thus adhering completely.

pound of chloride of lime. When cold, 
pour off the clear liquid, and keep in a 
lug ready for use. 

Surprising results are obtained from 
the use of hydrogen peroxide in the 
restoration of old copper or steel engrav- 
ings or lithographs which have become 
soiled or yellow, and this without the 
least injury to the picture. The cellulose 
which makes the substance of the paper 
resists the action of ozone, and the black 
carbon color of these prints is inde- 
structible. 

To remove grease or other spots ot 
dirt before bleaching, the engravings are 
treated with benzine. This is done by 
laying each one out flat in a shallow ves- 
sel and pouring the benzine over it. As 
benzine evaporates very rapidly, the 
vessel must be kept well covered, and 
since its vapors are also exceedingly in- 
flammable, no fire or smoking should be 
allowed in the room. The picture is 
left for several hours, then lifted out 
and dried in the air, and finally brushed 
several times with a soft brush. The 
dust which was kept upon the paper by 
the grease now lies more loosely upon it 
and can easily be removed by brushing. 

In many cases the above treatment is 
sufficient to improve the appearance of 
the picture. In the case of very old or 
badly soiled engravings, it is followed 
by a second, consisting in the immersion 
of the picture in a solution of sodium 
carbonate or a very dilute solution of 
caustic soda, it being left as before for 
several hours. After the liquid has been 
poured off, the picture must be repeated- 
ly rinsed in clear water, to remove any 
remnant of the soda. 

By these means the paper is so far 
cleansed that only spots of mold or 
other discolorations remain. These may 
be removed by hydrogen peroxide, in a 
fairly strong solution. The commercial 
peroxide may be diluted with % parts 
water. 

The picture is laid in a shallow vessel, 
the peroxide poured over it, and the 
vessel placed in a strong light. Very 
soon the discolorations will pate. 

To Reduce Engravings. — Plaster casts, 
as we know, can be perceptibly reduced 
to size by treatment with water or 
alcohol, and if this is properly done, the 
reduction is so even that the cast loses 
nothing of its clear outline, but some- 
times even gains in this respect by con- 
traction. If it is desired to reduce an 
engraved plate, make a plaster cast of it, 
Ireat this with water or alcohol, and fill 
the new cast with some easily fusible 



metal. This model, which will be 
siderably smaller than the oricinaf 0 ^

Essences and Extracts of 
Fruits 

Preservation of Fruit Juices.— The 
juices of pulpy fruits, when fre-h, con- 
tain an active principle known as pectin 
which is the coagulating substance that 
forms the basis of fruit jellies. This it 
is which prevents the juice of berries 
and similar fruits from passing through 
filtering media. Pectin may be precipi- 
tated by the addition of alcohol, or by 
fermentation. The latter is the best, as 
the addition of alcohol to the fresh juices 
destroys their aroma and injures the 
taste. The induction of a light fermen- 
tation is far the better method, not only 
preserving, when carefully conducted, 
the taste and aroma of the fruit, but yield- 
ing far more juice. The fruit is crushed 
and the juice subsequently carefully but 
strongly pressed out. Sometimes the 
crushed fruit is allowed to stand awhile, 
and to proceed to a light fermentation 
before pressure is applied; but while a 
greater amount of juice is thus obtained, 
the aroma and flavor of the product are 
very sensibly injured by the procedure. 

To the juice thus obtained, add from 
1 to 2 per cent of sugar, and put away m 
a cool place (where the temperature will 
not rise over 70° or 75° F.). Fermenta- 
tion soon begins, and will proceed ior a 
few davs. As soon as the development 
of carbonic acid gas ceases, the juice 
begins to clear itself, from the surface 
downward, and in a short time all fijjj* 
matter will lie in a mass at the bot torn, 
leaving the liquid bright and cieiu-

temperature, and maintaining at this 
temperature until the juice while still 
hot is poured into them. If now closed 
with corks similarly asepticized, or by 
dipping into hot melted paraffine, the 
juice may be kept unaltered for years. 
It is better, however, to make the juice 
at once into syrup, using the best, refined 
sugar, and boiling in a copper kettle 
(iron or tin spoil the color), following the 
usual precautions as to skimming, etc. 
The syrup should be poured hot into the 
bottles previously heated as before de- 
scribed.

quantities for a considerable time if cov-

A common way in which they are W 
from fermenting is by the use of saliSS 
acid or other antiseptic substance, which 
destroys the fermentative germ, or other- 
wise retards its action for a considerable 
time. The use of this acid is seriously 
objected to by some as injurious to the 
consumer. About 2 ounces of salievlif 



□y some as injurious to the 

„ About 2 ounces of salicylic 

acid, previously dissolved in alcohol, to 
25 gallons of juice, or 40 grains to the 
gallon, is generally considered the proper 
proportion. 

Another method adopted is to fill the 
freshly prepared cold juice into bottles 
until it reaches the necks, and on the top 
of this fruit juice a little glycerine 13 
placed. 

Juices thus preserved will keep in an 
unchanged condition in any season. 
Probably one of the best methods of pre- 
serving fruit juices is to add 15 per cent 
of 95 per cent alcohol. Gmsuch an ad- 
dition, albumen and mucilaginous matter 
will be deposited. The juice may then 
be stored in large bottles, jars, or barrels, 
if securely closed, and when clear, so 
that further clarification is unnecessary, 
the juice should finally be decanted or 
siphoned off.

the greater density of the syrup at the

or that still carrying imprisoned gases, 
remaining on top until it is freed from

this only partially, since it cannot entirely 
overcome the results of the natural forces 
in action. The consequence is more or

mulas usually recommended, the reason 
being apparent in the first step in the 
process. 

Coffee Essence.— 

Best ground Mocha 

coffee , 4 pounds 

Best ground chicory. . 2 pounds 
Boil with 2 gallons of water in a closed 
vessel and when cold, strain, press, and 
make up to 2 gallons, and to this add 
Rectified spirit of wine 8 ounces 
Pure glycerine (fluid) 16 ounces 
Add syrup enough to make 4 gallons, 
and mix intimately. 

Cucumber Essence. — Press the juice 
from cucumbers, mix with an equal vol- 
ume of alcohol and distil. If the distil- 
late is not sufficiently perfumed, more 
juice may be added and the mixture dis- 
tilled. It is said that the essence thus 
prepared will not spoil when mixed with 
fats in the preparation of cosmetics. 

Fruit Jelly Extract. — Fill into separate 
paper bags: 

Medium finely pow- 
dered gelatin 18 parts 

Medium finely pow- 
dered citric acid 3 parts 

Likewise into a glass bottle a mixture of 
any desired 

Fruit essence 1 part 

Spirit of wine 1 part 

and dissolve in the mixture for obtain- 
ing the desired color, raspberry red or 
lemon yellow, part. 

! For use, dissolve the gelatin and the 
citric acid in boiling water, adding 

Sugar 125 parts 

and mixing before cooling with the fruit 
essence mixture. 

Ginger Extracts.— The following is an 
excellent method of preparing a soluble 
essence or extract of ginger: 

I. — Jamaica ginger 24 ounces 

Rectified spirits, 60 

per cent 45 ounces 

Water 15 ounces 

Mix and let macerate together with 
frequent agitations for 10 days, then per- 
colate, press off, and filter. The yield 
should be 45 ounces. Of this take 40 
ounces and mix with an equal amount of 
distilled water. Dissolve: 6 drachms of 
sodium phosphate in 5 ounces of boiling 
water ; let cool and add the solution to the 
filtrate and water, mixing well. Add 2 
drachms of calcium chloride dissolved in 
ounces of water, nearly cold, and again 



thoroughly shake the whole. Lp+ , 
for 12 hours; then filter. tatl( i 
Put the filtrate in a still, and distil off 
at as slow a temperature as possible £a 
ounces, bet this distillate to one i\A 
and continue the distillation till anoth ' 
40 ounces have passed, then let the stS 
cool. The residue in the still, some la 
ounces, is the desired essence. Pour o t 
all that is possible and wash the still wit? 
the 30 ounces of distillate first set aside 
This takes up all that is essential" 
Finally, filter once more, through double 
filter paper and preserve the filtrate— 
about 40 ounces, of an amber-colored 
liquid containing all of the essentials of 
Jamaica ginger. 

Soluble Essence of Ginger. — II. The 

following is Harrop's method of proceed- 
ing: 

Fluid extract of gin- 
ger (U. S.) 4 ounces 

Pumice, in moder- 
ately fine powder . . 1 ounce 

Water enough to make 12 ounces 

Pour the fluid extract into a bottle, add 
the pumice and shake the mixture and 
repeat the shaking in the course of several 
hours. Now add the water in propor- 
tion of about 2 ounces, shaking well and 
frequently after each addition. When 
all is added repeat the agitation occa- 
sionally during 24 hours, then filter, 
returning the last portion of the filtrate 
until it comes through clear, and if nec- 
essary add sufficient water to make 12 
ounces. 

III. — Jamaica ginger, 

ground 2 pounds 

Pumice stone, ground 2 ounces 

Lime, slaked 2 ounces 

Alcohol, dilute 4 pints 

Rub the ginger with the pumice stone 
and lime until thoroughly mixed. J I° lste j 
wiLh the dilute alcohol until saturated and 
place in a narrow percolator, being care- 
ful not to use force in packing, biitsmW 
putting it in to obtain the position ot a 
powder to be percolated, so that W 
menstruum will go through unnorroi}' 
Finally, add the dilute alcohol and pro- 
ceed until 4 pints of percolate are o 
tained. Allow the liquid to stand w 
24 hours; then filter if necessary.

Raspberry Syrup, without Alcohol or 
Antiseptics.— The majority of producers 
of truit juices are firmly convinced that 
the preservation of these juices without 
the addition of alcohol, salicylic acid 
etc., is impossible. _ Herr Steiner's procl 
ess to the contrary is here reproduced: 

The fruit is crushed and pressed; the 
juice, with 2 per cent of sugar added, is 
poured into containers to about three- 
quarters of their capacity, and there al- 
lowed to ferment. The containers are 
stoppered with a cork through which 
runs a tube, whose open end is protected 
by a bit of gum tubing, the extremity of 
which is immersed in a glass filled with 
water. It should not go deeper than 
-yijj of an inch high. The evolution o( 
carbonic gas begins in about 4 hours 
and is so sharp that the point of the tube 
must not be immersed any deepen 

Ordinarily fermentation ceases on the 
tenth day, a fact that may be ascertained 
by shaking the container sharply, when, 
if it has ceased, no bubbles of gas will 
appear on the surface of the water. 

The fermented juice is then filtered to 
cet rid of the pectinic matters, yeast, etc., 
and the filtrate should be poured back on 
the filter several times The mice filters 
nuickly and comes off very clear. Ine 
Tees ary amount of sugar to make a

ESSENCES AND EXTRACTS 



fermentation, the production of alcohol 
is progressing all the time — a demonstra- 
tion that fermentation cannot then be 
completed, and that at least 10 days will 
be required for this purpose. 

An abortive raspberry syrup is always 
due to an incomplete or faulty fermenta- 
tion, for too often does it occur that in- 
completely fermented Juices after a little 
time lose color and become turbid. 

The habit of clarifying juices by shak- 
ing up with a bit of paper, talc, etc., or 
boding with albumen is a useless waste 
of time and labor. By the process indi- 
cated the entire process of clarification 
occurs automatically, so to speak. 

Deep Red Raspberry Syrup. — A much 
deeper and richer color than that ordi- 
narily attained may be secured by add- 
ing to crushed raspberries, before fer- 
mentation, small quantities of sugar, sifted 
over the surface in layers. The ethylic 
alcohol produced by fermentation in this 
manner aids in the extraction of the 
red colorin'g matter of the fruit. More- 
over, the fermented juice should never 
be cooked over a lire, but by super- 
heated steam. Only in this way can 
caramclization be completely avoided. 
Only sugar free from ultramarine and 
chalk should be used in making the 
syrup, as these impurities also have a 
bad influence on the color. 

Raspberry Essences.— 
I. — Raspberries, fresh . . 16 ounces 

Angelica (California) 6 fluidounces 
Brandy (California) 6 ounces 

Alcohol 6 ounces 

Water, quantity sufficient. 

Mash the berries to a pulp in a mortar 
or bowl, and transfer to a flask, along 
with the Angelica, brandy, alcohol, and 
about 8 ounces of water. Let macerate 
overnight, then distil off until 32 ounces 
have _ passed over. Color red. The 
addition of a trifle of essence of vanilla 
improves this essence. 

II. — Fresh raspberries, . . 200 grams 

Water, distilled 100 grams 

Vanilla essence 2 grams 

Pulp the raspberries, let stand at a 
temperature of about 70° F. for 48 hours, 
and then add 100 grams of water. Fifty 
grams are then distilled off, and alcohol, 
90 per cent, 25 grams, in which 0.01 
vanillin has been previously dissolved, 
is added to the distillate.

and rub with carbonate of magnesium

quart bottle, and fill the bottle witK 
water. Allow to macerate for a we S 
or more, shaking every day. Then filter 
through the paper, adding enough water 
through the paper to make the finished 
product measure 2 pints. 

Strawberry Juice.— Put into the water 
bath 1,000 parts of distilled water and 
600 parts of sugar and boil, with con- 
stant skimming, until no more scum 
arises. Add 5 parts of citric acid and 
continue the boiling until about 1,250 
parts are left. Stir in, little by little, 
500 parts of fresh strawberries, properly 
stemmed, and be particularly careful 
not to crush the fruit. When all the 
berries are added, cover the vessel, re- 
move from the fire, put into a warm place 
and let stand, closely covered, for 3 hours, 
or until the mass has cooled down to the 
surrounding temperature, then strain off 
through flannel, being careful not to 
crush the berries. Prepare a sufficient 
number of pint bottles by filling them 
with warm water, putting them into a 
kettle of the same and heating them to 
boiling, then rapidly emptying and 
draining as quickly as possible. Into 
these pour the hot juice, cork and seal 
the bottles as rapidly as possible. Juice 
thus prepared retains all the aroma and 
flavor of the fresh berry, and if carefully 
corked and sealed up will retain its 
properties a year.

portions as before. Mix the results of 
the three infusions first made, filter, and 
wash the filter paper with the results of 
the percolation, allowing the filtered per- 
colate to mingle with the filtrate of the 
mixed infusions. 

II. — Take 60 parts of the best vanilla 
beans, cut into little pieces, and put into 
a deep vessel, wrapped with a cloth to 
retain the heat as long as possible. 
Shake over the vanilla 1 part of potas- 
sium carbonate in powder, and immedi- 
ately add 240 parts distilled water, in an 
active state of ebullition. Cover the 
vessel closely, set aside until it is com- 
pletely cold, and then add 720 parts 
alcohol. Cover closely, and set aside in 
a moderately warm place for 15 days, 
when the liquid is strained off, the resi- 
due pressed, and the whole colate filtered. 
The addition of 1 part musk to the 
vanilla before pouring on the hot water 
improves this essence. 

To prepare vanilla fountain syrup 
with extracts I or II, mix 25 minims of the 
extract with 1 pint simple syrup. Color 
with caramel.

ETCHING 



Etching 

General Instructions for Etching. — 
In etching, two factors come into con- 
sideration, (1) that which covers that 
part of the metal not exposed to the 
etching fluid:, (the resist), and (2) the 
etching fluid itself. ... 

In the process, a distinction is to be 
made between etching in _ relief and 
etching in intaglio. In relief etching, 
the design is drawn or painted upon the 
surface with the liquid etching-ground, 
so that after etching and removal of the 
etching-ground, it appears raised. In 
intaglio etching, the whole surface is 
covered with the etching-ground, and 
the design put on with a needle; the 
ground being thus removed at the points 
to, ached by the drawing, the latter, after 
etching and removal of the etching- 
ground, is sunken. 

Co vering Agents or Resists. — The plate 
is enclosed by a border made of grafting 
wax (yellow beeswax, 8 parts; pine rosin, 
10 parts; beef tallow, 2 parts; turpentine, 
10 parts); or a mixture of yellow wax, 
8 parts; lard, 3 parts; Burgundy pitch, 
J part. This mixture is also used to 
cover the sides of vessels to be etched. 
Another compound consists of wax, 5 
parts; cobbler's wax, 2 % parts; turpentine, 

1 part. 

Etching - Ground. I. - Soft : Wax, 

2 parts; asphalt, 1 part; mastic, 1 part. 

II. — Wax, 3 parts; asphalt, 4 parts. 

III. — Mastic, 16 parts; Burgundy pitch, 
50 parts; melted wax, 125 parts; and 
melted asphalt, 200 parts added succes- 
sively, and, after cooling, turpentine oil, 
500 parts. If the ground should be deep 
black, lampblack is added. 

Hard: Burgundy pitch, 125 parts; 
rosm, 125 parts, melted; and walnut oil, 
100_ parts, added, the whole to be boiled 
until it can be drawn out into long 
threads. 

\ Etching-Ground for Copper Engrav- 
ing.— White wax, 120 parts; mastic, 15 
parts; Burgundy pitch, 60 parts; Syrian 
asphalt, 120 parts, melted together; and 
5 parts concentrated solution of rubber 
in rubber oil added. 

Ground for Relief Etching. — I. — Syrian 
asphalt, 500 parts, dissolved in turpen- 
tine oil, 1,000 parts. II.— Asphalt, rosin,

If absolute suretv is recmhwl ^ 
ing the resistance of the $^3** 
to the action of the etching flu3f,S 
etching-grounds are put on, one over S 
other; first (for instance), a solution of 
rubber in benzol, then a spirituous shel 
lac solution and a third stratum of 
asphalt dissolved in turpentine oil 

If the etching is to he of different de 
grees of depth, the places where it is to 
be faint are stopped out with varnish 
after they are deep enough, and the oh' 
ject is put back into the bath for further 
etching. 

For putting on a design before the 
etching, the following method may be 
used: Cover the metal plate, tin plate 
for example, with a colored or colorless 
spirit varnish; after drying, cover this, in 
a dark room, with a solution of gelatin, 
5 parts, and red potassium chroinate, 1 
part, in water, 100 parts; or with a 
solution of albumen, 2 parts; ammonium 
bichromate, 2 parts, in water, .200 parts, 
After drying, put the plate, covered with 
a stencil, in a copying or printing frame, 
and expose to light. The sensitive gela- 
tin stratum will become insoluble at the 
places exposed. Place in water, and the 
gelatin will be dissolved at the places 
covered by the stencil; dry, and remove 
the spirit varnish from the places with 
spirit, then put into the etching fluid. 

Etching Fluids. —The etching fluid is 
usually poured over the metallic surface, 
which" is enclosed in a border, as de- 
scribed before. If the whole object is Jo 
be put into the fluid, it must he entirely 
covered with the etching-ground. After 
etching it is washed with pure water, 
dried with a linen cloth, and the etching- 
ground is then washed oil' with turpentine 
oil or a light volatile camphor oil- 
latter is very good for the purpose

For lustrous figures on a dull ground, 
as on sword blades, the whole surface is 
polished, the portions which are to re- 
main bright covered with stencils and 
the object exposed to the fumes of nitric 
acid. This is best done by pouring sul- 
phuric acid, 20 parts, over common salt, 
10 parts. 

Relief Etching of Copper, Steel, and 
Brass. — Instead of nitric acid, which has 
a tendency to lift up the etching-ground, 
by_ evolution of gases, it is better to use a 
mixture of potassium bichromate, 150 
parts; water, 800 parts; and concentrated 
sulphuric acid, 200 parts. The etching 
is slow, but even, and there is no odor. 

For Etching Copper, Brass, and Tom- 
bac—Pure nitric acid diluted with water 
to 18° Be. The bubbles of gas given out 
should immediately be removed with a 
feather that the etching may be even. 
, Another compound consists of a boil- 
ln g solution of potassium chlorate, 2 
Parts, in water, 20 parts, poured into a

solution of bromine m dilute hydro- 
chloric acid may also be used; or a mix- 
ture of potassium bichromate, $ part; 
water, 1 part; crude nitric acid, 3 parts. " 

The following are also much used for 
copper and copper alloys: 

I- — A copper chloride solution acidi 
tied with hydrochloric acid. 

II. — Copper nitrate dissolved in water 

III. — A ferric chloride solution of 30° 
to 45° Be. If chrome gelatin or chror 
albumen is used for the etching-groum 
a spirituous ferric chloride solution is 
employed. The etching process can be 
made slower by adding common salt to 
the ferric chloride solution. 

Matt Etching of Copper. — White vi- 
triol, 1 to 5 parts; common salt, 1 part; 
concentrated sulphuric acid, 100 parts; 
nitric acid (36° Be.), 200 parts, mixed 
together. The sulphuric acid is to be 
poured carefully into the nitric acid, not 
the reverse. 

Etching Fluid for Brass.— Nitrie acid,

ETCHING 



"Etching Fluid for Aluminum. — Dilute 
hydrochloric acid serves this purpose. 
Aluminum containing iron can be mat- 
ted with soda lye, followed by treatment 
with nitric acid. The lye dissolves the 
aluminum, and the nitric acid dissolves 
the iron. Aluminum bronze is etched 
with nitric acid. 

Etching Fluid for Tin or Pewter.— 
Ferric chloride, or highly diluted nitric 
acid. 

Etching Fluids for Silver. — I. — Dilute 
pure nitric acid. 

II. — Nitric acid (specific weight, 
1.185), 172 parts; water, 320 parts; 
potassium bichromate, 30 parts. 

Etching Fluid for Gold. — Dilute aqua 
regia (^nitric and sulphuric acids, in the 
proportion of 1 in 3). 

Etching Fluid for Copper, Zinc, and 
Steel. — A mixture of 4 parts of acetic 
acid (30 per cent), and alcohol, 1 part; 
to this is added gradually, nitric acid, 1 
part. 

Etching Fluid for Lead, Antimony, 
md Britannia Metal. — Dilute nitric acid. 

Etching Powder for Metals (Tin, 
Silver, Iron, German Silver, Copper, and 
Zinc). — Blue vitriol, 1 part; ferric oxide, 
4 parts. The powder, moistened, is ap- 
plied to the places to be etched, as, for 
instance, knife blades. Calcined green 
vitriol can also be used. 

Electro-Etching.— This differs from 
ordinary etching in the use of a bath, 
which does not of itself affect the metal, 
but is made capable of doing so by the 
galvanic current 

Ordinary etching, seen under the 
microscope, consists of a succession of 
uneven depressions, which widen out 
considerably at a certain depth. In elec- 
tro-etching, the line under the micro- 
scope appears as a perfectly even furrow, 
not eaten out beneath, however deeply 
cut. The work is, accordingly, finer and 
sharper; the fumes from the acids are 
also avoided, and the etching can be 
modified by regulation of the current, 
lne preparation of the surface, by cov- 
ering stopping-out, etc., is the same as 
in ordinary etching. At some uncovered 
P -tP e a j. conduc ting wire is soldered on 
with soft solder, and covered with a coat 
pt varnish. The plate is then suspended 
in the bath, and acts as the anode, with 
another similar plate for the cathode, 
■t gradations in etching are desired, the 
nates are taken out after a time, rinsed, 
and covered, and returned to the bath. 
l"or the bath dilute acids are used, 



or saline solutions. Thus for

Etching on Copper. — I. — In order to 
do regular and quick etching on copper 
take a copper plate silvered on the etch- 
ing side. Trace on this plate, either with 
varnish or lithographic ink, the design. 
When the tracing is dry, place the plate 
in an iron bath, using" a battery. The 
designs traced with the varnish" or ink 
arc not attacked by the etching fluid. 
When the plate is taken from the bath 
and has been washed and dried, remove 
the varnish or ink with essence of turpen- 
tine; next pour mercury on the places 
reserved by the varnish or ink; the mer- 
cury will attack the silvered portions and 
the etching is quickly made. When the 
mercury has done its duty gather up the 
excess and return to the bottle with a 
paper funnel. Wash the plate in strong 
alum water, and heat. 

, II.— The plate must be first polished 
either with emery or fine pumice stone, 
and after it has been dried with care, 
spread thereon a varnish composed of 
equal parts of yellow wax and essence 
of turpentine. The solution of the wax 
in the essence is accomplished in tfl ^ 
cold; next a little oil of turpentine and 
some lampblack are added. This var- 
nish is allowed to dry on, away fr° ra 
dust and humidity. When <fcy»-J^jJ!

ETCHING ON GLASS. 

Names, designs, etc., can be etched on 
glass in three ways: First, by means or an 
engraving wheel, a method which requires 
some manual skill. Second, by means of a 
sand blast, making a stencil of the name, 
fixing this on the glass, and then, by means 
of a blast of air, blowing sand on the glass. 
Third, by the use of hydrofluoric acid. 
The glass is covered with beeswax, par- 
affine wax, or some acid resisting ink or 
varnish - , the name or device is then 
etched out of the wax by means of a knife, 
and the glass dipped in hydrofluoric acid, 
which eats away the glass at those parts 
where the wax has been cut away- 
Fancy work, ornamental figures, let- 
tering, and monograms are most easily 
and neatly cut into glass by the sand- 
blast process. Lines and figures on 
tu bes, jars, etc., may be deeply etched by 
smearing the surface of the glass with 
beeswax, drawing the lines with a steel 
Point, and exposing the glass to the fumes 
of hydrofluoric acid. This acid is ob- 
tained by putting powdered fluorspar 
? n to a t ra y made of sheet lead and pour- 
™g sulphuric acid on it, after which the 
H" a y is slightly warmed. The propor- 
^ 0l is will vary with the purity of the 
"^terials used, fluorspar (except when in 
fystals) being generally mixed with a. 
ar ,ge quantity of other matter. Enough

Qer ed spar will be about right. Where a

els. Liquid hydrofluoric acid has

vessels, liquid hydrofluoric "acid 
been recommended for etching but is 
not always suitable, as it leaves the 
surtace on which it acts transparent. 

There are two methods of marking 
bottles — dry etching, or by stamping 
with etching inks. The first process is 
usually followed in glass factories. A 
rubber stamp is necessary for this proc- 
ess, and the letters should be made a 
large and clean cut as possible withou 
crowding them too much. Besides this 
an etching powder is required. 

A small quantity of the powder 
poured into a porcelain dish, and this is 
placed on a sand bath or over a geutl 
fire, and heated until it is absolutely drj . 
so that it can be rubbed down to an im- 
palpable powder. 

The bottle or other glass to be marked 
must be perfectly clean and dry. The 
etching powder takes better when the 
vess el is somewhat warm. The stair- 
should be provided with a roller which 
kept constantly supplied with a viscid oJ 
which it distributes ou the stamp and 
which the stamp transfers to .the glass 
surface The powder is dusted on the

then transfer to a lead dish, and make into 
a thin writing-cream with hydrofluoric 
acid or fuming sulphuric acid. Use a 
piece of lead to stir the mixture. The 
ink may be put up in bottles coated with 
paraffine, which can be done by heating 
the bottle, pouring in some melted paraf- 
fine, and letting it flow all around. The 
writing is done with a quill, and in about 
half a minute the ink is washed off. 

Extreme caution must be observed in 
handling the acid, since when brought in 
contact with the skin it produces dan- 
gerous sores very difficult to heal. The 
vapor is also dangerously poisonous 
when inhaled. 

Hydrofluoric Formulas. — I. — Dissolve 
about 0.72 ounces fluoride of soda with 
0.14 ounces sulphate of potash in * pint 
of water. Make another solution of 0.2S 
ounces chloride of zinc and 1.30 ounces 
hydrochloric acid in an equal quantity of 
water. Mix the solutions and apply to 
the glass vessel with a pin or brush. At 
the end of half an hour the design should 
be sufficiently etched. 

II. — A mixture consisting of ammo- 
nium fluoride, common salt, and carbon- 
ate of soda is prepared, and then placed 
in a gutta-percha bottle containing fum- 
ing hydrofluoric acid and concentrated 
sulphuric acid. In a separate vessel 
which is made of lead, potassium fluoride 
is mixed with hydrochloric acid, and a 
little of this solution is added to the 
former, along with a small quantity of 
sodium silicate and ammonia. Some 
of the solution is dropped upon a rubber 
pad, and by means of a suitable rubber 
stamp, bearing the design which is to be 
reproduced, is transferred to the glass 
vessel that is to be etched. 

Etching with Wax.— Spread wax or 
a preservative varnish on the glass, and 
trace on this wax or varnish the letters 
or designs. If letters are desired, trace 
them by hand or by the use of letters 
cut out in tin, which apply on the wax, 
the inside contours being taken with a 
fine point. When this is done, remove 
the excess of wax from the glass, leav- 
ing only the full wax letters undis- 
turbed. Make an edge of wax all along 
the glass plate so as to prevent the acid 
train running over when vou pour it on 
to attack the glass. At the end of 3 to 4 
i, ra . r f; move the acid, wash the glass 
well with hot water, next pour on essence 
ot turpentine or alcohol to take off the 
wax or the preservative varnish. Pass 
again through clean water; the glass 
P - j i, ave becom « dead wherever the 
acid has eaten id, only the letters remain- 



ing polished. For fancy designs it i 
flees to put on the back of tE plated 
black or colored varnish, or tin foil + 
to obtain a brilliant effect. * 

Etching Glass by Means of Glue — t* 
is necessary only to cover a pi ece of "i 1 
nary or flint glass with a coat of a hj c §■£ 
solved on water in order to sec that 
layer of glue, upon contracting through 
the effect of drymg, becomes detached 
from the glass and removes therefrom 
numerous scales of varying thickne* 
The glass thus etched presents a sort of 
regular and decorative design similar to 
the flowers of frost deposited on window 
panes in winter. -When salts that are 
readily crystalhzable and that exert no 
chemical action upon the gelatin are 
dissolved in the latter the figures etched 
upon the glass exhibit a crystalline ap- 
pearance that recalls fern fronds. 

< Hyposulphite of soda and chlorate and 
nitrate of potash produce nearly the same 
effects. A large number of mineral sub- 
stances are attacked by gelatin. Tough- 
ened glass is easily etched, and the same 
is the case with fluorspar and polished 
marble, A piece of rock crystal, cut at 
right angles with the axis and"coated with 
isinglass, the action of which seems to be 
particularly^ energetic, is likewise at- 
tacked at different points, and the parts 
detached present a conchoidal appear- 
ance. Trie contraction of the gelatin 
may be rendered visible by applying a 
coating of g] ue to sheets of cardboard or 
lead, which bend backward in drying 
and assume the form of an irregular 
cylinder. 

Such etching of glass and different 
mineral substances by the action of gela- 
tin may be employed for the decoration 
of numerous objects. 

Dissolve some common glue in ordi- 
nary water, heated by a water bath, and 
add 6 per cent of its weight of potash 
alum. After the glue has become per- 
fectly melted, homogeneous, and of the 
consistency of syrup, applv a layer, while 
it is still hot, to a glass object by means 
of a brush. If the object is of ground 
glass the action of the glue will be still 
more energetic. After half an hour ap- 
ply a second coat in such a way as to ob- 
tain a smooth, transparent surface desti- 
tute of air bubbles. After the gluenaa 
become so hard that it no longer yields to 
the pressure of the finger nail (say, i n 
about 24 hours), put the article m » 
wanner place, in which the temperature 
must not exceed 105° F. When the 
object is removed from the oven, after ■ a 
few hours, the glue will detach itself wita

Indelible Labels on Bottles. — To affix 
indelible labels on bottles an etching 
liquid is employed which is produced as 
follows: a 

Liquid I, in one bottle. — Dissolve 36 
parts of sodium fluoride in 500 parts of 
distilled water and add 7 parts of potas- 
sium sulphate. 

Liquid II, in another bottle.— Dissolve 
zinc chloride, 14 parts, in 500 parts of dis- 
tilled water, and add 65 parts of concen- 
trated hydrochloric acid. 

For use mix equal parts together and 
add a little dissolved India ink to render 
the writing more visible. 

The mixing cannot, however, be con- 
ducted in a vessel. It is best to use a. 
cube of paraffine which has been hol- 
lowed out. 

Etching on Marble or Ivory (see 
also Ivory).— Cover the objects with a 
coat of wax dissolved in 90 per cent 
alcohol, then trace the desired designs 
by removing the wax with a_ sharp 
tool and distribute on the tracing the 
following mixture: Hydrochloric acid, 
1 part; acetic acid, 1 part. Eepeat 
this operation several times, until the 
desired depth is attained. Then take 
°n the varnish with alcohol. The eteh- 
v 11 ? may be embellished, filling up the 
b ?Uows with any colored varnish, by 
Wiping the surface with a piece of linen 
on a stick, to rub the varnish into 
lQ e cavities after it has been applied with 
a brush. The hollows may be gilded or 
Jeered by substituting "mixtion" for 
ne varnish and applying on this mixtion

clean up the print, so that the lines wi 11

otherwise. Next a good strong heatin 
should be given. On top the dragon'

For etching use nitric acid mixed wi 
an even amount of acetic acid. Som 
operators use vinegar, based on the sam 
theory. When commencing the etchin 
start with a weak solution and increase 
soon as the plate is deep enough to alio 
another powdering. If the operator 
familiar with lithography, and unde 
stands rolling up the print with a lith 
roller, the etching of steel is not hard 
than etching on zinc.

coating, and this may be evenly spread 
with a knife heated in the candle flame. 

VI. — For Hardened Steel. — Heat an 
iron or an old pillar-file with a smooth 
side, and with it spread a thin, even coat 
of beeswax over the brightened surface to 
be etched. With a sharp lead pencil 
(which is preferable to a scriber) write 
or mark as wanted through the wax so as 
to be sure to strike the steel surface. 
Then daub on with a stick etching acid 
made as follows: Nitric acid, 3 parts; 
muriatic acid, 1 part. If a lead pencil 
has been used the acid will begin to bub- 
ble immediately. Two or three minutes 
of the bubbling or foaming will be suf- 
ficient for marking; then soak up the 
acid with a small piece of blotting paper 
and remove the beeswax with a piece of 
cotton waste wet with benzine, and if 
the piece be small enough dip it into a 
saturated solution of sal soda, or if the 
piece be large swab over it with a piece of 
waste. This neutralizes the remaining 
acid and prevents rusting, which oil will 
not do. 

If it is desired to coat the piece with 
beeswax without heating it, dissolve 
pure beeswax in benzine until of the 
consistency of thick cream and pour on 
to the steel, and even spread it by rocking 
or blowing, and lay aside for it to harden ; 
then use the lead pencil, etc., as before. 
This method will take longer. Keep 
work from near the fire or an open flame.

Explosives 

Explosives may be divided into two 
great classes — mechanical mixtures and 
chemical compounds. In the former the 
combustible substances are intimately 
mixed with some oxygen supplying 
materia], as in the case of gunpowder, 
where carbon and sulphur are inti- 
mately mixed with potassium nitrate; 
while gun cotton and nitro-glycerine are 
examples of the latter class, where each 
molecule of the substance contains the 
necessary oxygen for the oxidation of 
the carbon and hydrogen present, the 
oxygen being in feeble combination with 
nitrogen. Many explosives are, how- 
e Xf. r ' me chanical mixtures of compounds 
which, are themselves explosive, e. g„ 
cordite, which is mainly composed of 
gun cotton and nitro-glycerine. 



The most common and familiar *f 
explosives is undoubtedly gunpowder 
The mixture first adopted appear £ 
have consisted of equal parts of %k 
three ingredients— sulphur, charcoal S 
niter; but some time later the pronn^ 
tions, even now taken for all ordinal 
purposes, were introduced, namely; y 

Potassium nitrate. ... 75 parts 
Charcoal 15 tg 

Sul P Lur 10 parts 

100 parts 

Since gunpowder is a mechanical miv 
ture, it is clear that the first aim of the 
maker must be to obtain perfect incor- 
poration, and, necessarily, in order to 
obtain this, the materials must be in a 
very finely divided state. Moreove? 
in order that uniformity of effect may De 
obtained, purity of the original sub- 
stances, the percentage of moisture pres- 
ent, and the density of the finished 
powder are of importance. 

The weighed quantities of the ingre- 
dients are first mixed in gun metal or 
copper drums, having blades in the 
interior capable of working in the op- 
posite direction to that in which the 
drum itself is traveling. After passing 
through _ a sieve, the mixture (green 
charge) is passed on to the incorporating 
mills, where it is thoroughly ground un- 
der heavy metal rollers, a small quan- 
tity of water being added to prevent 
dust and facilitating incorporation, and 
during this process the risk of explosion 
is greater possibly than at any other 
stage in the manufacture. There are 
usually 6 mills working in the same 
building, with partitions between. Over 
the bed of each mill is a horizontal board, 
the "flash board," which is connected 
with a tank of water overhead, the ar- 
rangement being such that the upsetting 
of one tank discharges the contents of 
the other tanks onto the corresponding 
mill beds below, so that in the event oi 
an accident the charge is drowned in 
each case. The "mill cake" if 
broken down between rollers, the "meat 
produced being placed in strong oaK 
boxes and subjected to hydraulic pres- 
sure, thus increasing its density aria 
hardness, at the same time bringing tn« 
ingredients into more intimate contact. 
After once more breaking down tM 
material (press cake), the powder only 
requires special treatment to adapt 
for the various purposes for which it 
intended. . f

readily separates from the mixed acids, 
an d being insoluble in cold water, the 
hashing is comparatively simple. 

Ni tr0 _o-l v cerine is an oily liquid readily 
soluble hi most organic solvents, but 
becomes solid at 3° or 4° above the 
freezing point of water, and m this con- 
dition is less sensitive. It detonates 
when heated to 500° F„ or by a sudden 
How, yielding carbon dioxide, oxygen, 
litrogen, and water. Being a fluid un- 
der ordinary conditions, its uses as an 
explosive were limited, and Alfred Nobel 
uonceived the idea of mixing it with other 
[substances which would act as absorb- 
ents, first using charcoal and afterwards 
an infusorial earth, "kieselgubr," and 
obtaining what he termed "dynamite." 
Kobel found that "collodion cotton" — 
soluble gun cotton — could be converted 
by treatment with nitro-glycerine into a 
jellylike mass which was more trust- 
worthy in action than the components 
ilone, and from its nature the substance 
was christened "blasting gelatin." 

Nobel took out a patent for a smoke- 
less powder for use in guns, in which 
these ingredients were adopted with or 
Without the use of retarding agents. 
Ine powders of this class are ballistite 
and filite, the former being in sheets, the 
latter in threads. Originally camphor

Gun cotton to be used for cordite is 
prepared as previously described, but 
the alkali is omitted, and the mass i3 not 
submitted to great pressure, to avoid 
making it so dense that ready absorption 
of nitro-glycerine would not take place. 
The nitro-glycerine is poured over th< 
dried gun cotton and first well mixed by 
hand, afterwards in a kneading machine 
with the requisite quantity of acetone 
for 3£ hours. A water jacket is provided, 
since, on mixing, the temperature rises. 
The vaseline is now added, and the 
kneading continued for a similar period. 
The cordite paste is first subjected to 
a preliminary pressing, and is finally 
forced through a hole of the proper size* 
in a plate either by hand or by hydraulic 
pressure. The smaller sizes are wound 
on drums, while the larger cordite is cut 
off in suitable lengths, the drums and 
cut material being dried at 100° F., thus 
driving off the remainder of the acetone. 

Cordite varies from yellow m to dark 
brown in color, according to its thick- 
ness. When ignited it burns with a 
strong flame, which may be extinguished 
by a vigorous puff of air. Macnab and

which has been treated in one of various 
ways to make it burn slower than gun 
cotton, and also to render it less sensitive 
to heat and shocks. As a rule, these 
powders are not only less inflammable 
than gun cotton, but require stronger 
detonators. As metallic _ salts cause 
smoke, they are not used in these pow- 
ders. The smokeless powders now in 
use may be divided into three groups: 
(1) Those consisting of mixtures of 
nitro-glycerine and nitrated cellulose, 
which have been converted into a hard, 
hornlike mass, either with or without 
the aid of a solvent. To this group be- 
longs ballistite, containing 50 per cent of 
nitro-glycerine, 49 per cent of nitrated 
cellulose, and 1 per cent of diphenyi- 
amin; also cordite (see further on), 
Lenord's powder, and amberite. This 
last contains 40 parts of nitro-glycerine 
and 56 parts of nitrated cellulose. (2) 
Those consisting mainly of nitrated cel- 
lulose of any kind, which has been ren- 
dered hard and horny by treatment with 
some solvent which is afterwards evapo- 
rated. These are prepared by treating 
nitrated cellulose with ether or benzine, 
which dissolves the collodion, and when 
evaporated leaves a hard film of collo- 
dion on the surface of each grain. 
Sometimes a little camphor is added to 
the solvent, and, remaining in the pow- 
der, greatly retards its combustion. (3) 
Those consisting of nitro-derivatives of 
the aromatic hydrocarbons, either with 
or without the admixture of nitrated 
cellulose; to this group belong Dupont's 
powder, consisting of nitrated cellulose 
dissolved in nitro-benzine; indurite, con- 
sisting of cellulose hexanitrate (freed 
from collodion by extraction with methyl 
alcohol), made into a paste with nitro- 
benzine, and hardened by treatment with 
steam until the excess of nitro-benzine is 
removed; and plastomeite, consisting of 
dinitrotoluene and nitrated wood pulp. 

Cordite is the .specific name of a 
smokeless powder which has been 
adopted by the English government as a 
military explosive. It contains nitro- 
glycerine, 58 parts; gun cotton, 37 parts; 
and petrolatum, 5 parts. The nitro- 
glycerine and gun cotton are first mixed, 
19.2 parts of acetone added, and the 
pasty mass kneaded for several hours. 
Ihe petrolatum is then added and the 
mixture again kneaded. The paste is 
then forced through fine openings to 
tot ™ threads, which are dried at about 

"Pi? i! Unt ^ t ' ie aceton3 evaporates. 
Ihe threads, which resemble brown 
twine, are then cut into short lengths for 
use. 



Another process for the Tr>n„ * 
of smokeless powder h nT^T^ 
fcraw, preferably, oat-straw, is treated 
the usua way with a mixture of 
acid and concentrated sulohurin D • ?

The excess of solution is pressfd 
and the mass is then pulverized, granu- 
lated, and finally dried. 

The warning as to the danger of 
penmenting with the manufacture of 
ordinary gunpowder applies with re 
newed force when nitro-glycerine is the 
subject of the experiment. 

Berge's Blasting Powder. —This i s 
composed of chlorate of potash, 1 part* 
chromate of potash, 0.1 part; sugar' 
0.45 parts; yellow wax, 0.09 parts. The" 
proportions indicated may vary within 
certain limits, according to the force 
desired. For the preparation, the chlo- 
rate and the chromate of potash, as well 
as the sugar, arc ground separately and 
very finely, and sifted so that the grains 
of the different substances may have Ihe 
same size. At first any two of the sub- 
stances are mixed as thoroughly as possi- 
ble, then the third is added. The yellow 
wax, cut in small pieces, is finally added, 
and all the substances are worked to- 
gether to produce a homogeneous prod- 
uct. The sugar may be replaced with 
charcoal or any other combustible body. 
For commercial needs, the compound 
may be colored with any inert matter, 
also pulverized. 

Safety in Explosives. — Ammoniacal 
salts have been used in the manufacture 
of explosives to render them proof 
against firedamp, but not with the full 
success desired. Ammonium chloride 
has been utilized, but inconveniences 
are met with, and the vapor is quite dis- 
agreeable. In cooperation with equiva- 
lent quantities of soda and potash, its 
action is regarded as favorable. Tes ts 
employing benzine vapor and coal th' 
were made, and the comparative security 
calculated to be as given below.

Inflammable Explosive with Chlorate

combustible agent, an oxidized, nitrated, 
or natural rosin. If, to such a mixture, 
another body is added in order to render 
^ soft and plastic, such as oil, nitro-ben-

with a final washing with pure water 
and dried at a temperature of 230° F or

The mixing of the constituents of this 
explosive is preferably cold. For this 
purpose they are used in the state of fine 
powder, and when mixed in the tub, 2^ 
to 5 per cent of a volatile dissolvent is 
added, as alcohol, carbon sulphide, 
ether, or benzine. As soon as thorough- 
ly mingled, the mass is put either in an 
ordinary grainer, or in a cylinder of wire 
cloth revolving horizontally on its axis, 
with glass gobilles forming a screen, by 
the aid of which the graining is rapidly 
accomplished. Thus a powder more or 
less finely granulated is produced free 
from dust. 

The proportions preferably employed 
are: 

1. Potassium chlorate. . . 85 parts 
Natural rosin 15 parts 

2. Potassium chlorate. . . 80 parts 
Nitrated rosin 20 parts 

For employment in firedamp mines, 
there is added to these compounds from 
20 to 40 per cent of one of the following 
substances: Ammonium oxalate, am- 
monium carbonate, oxalic acid, sodium 
bicarbonate, calcium fluoride, or other

fectly dry, it is removed to air-tight iron 
cases, in which it is allowed to cool. The 
iron cases are taken to the dipping 
houses, and the cotton waste weighed 
into small portions, which are then 
transferred as rapidly as possible to the 
mixed acids, allowed to remain a few 
minutes, then removed to the grating 
and the excess of acid squeezed out. 
The cotton now containing about ten 
times its weight of acid is placed in an 
earthenware pot and transferred to the 
steeping pits, where it is allowed to re- 
main for 24 hours, a low temperature 
being maintained by a stream of cold 
water. 

The cotton is now wholly converted 
into nitro-cellulose. The superfluous 
acid is next removed by a centrifugal 
extractor, after which the gun cotton is 
taken out of the machine and immedi- 
ately immersed in a large volume of 
water, and thoroughly washed until it 
shows no acid reaction. The moisture 
is then run out and the gun cotton is con- 
veyed by tramway to the boiling vats, 
where it undergoes several boilings by 
means of steam. When the "heat teat" 
shows that a sufficient degree of stability 
has been obtained, the gun cotton is re- 
moved to a beating engine, and reduced 
to a very fine state of division. When 
this process is completed the pulp is run 
by gravity along wooden shoots, pro- 
vided with "grit traps" and electro- 
magnets, which catch any traces of sand, 
iron, etc., into large "poachers," in 
which the gun cotton is continuously 
agitated, together with a large quantity 
of water. In this way it is thoroughly 
washed and a blend made of a large 
quantity of gun cotton. 

Soluble Gun Cotton. — Soluble gun 
cotton is made on the same lines, except 
that greater attention has to be paid to 
the physical condition of the cotton used, 
and to the temperature and strength of 
acid mixture, etc. 

The term "soluble" usually implies 
that the gun cotton is dissolved by a mix- 
ture of ethyl- ether and ethyl- alcohol, 2 
parts of the former to I of the latter being 
the proportions which yield the best 
solvent action. The classification of 
nitro-celluloses according to their solu- 
bility in ether-alcohol is misleading, 
-except when the nitrogen contents are 
also quoted. 

The number of solvents for gun cotton 
which have at various times been pro- 
posed is very large. Among the more 
important may be mentioned the follow- 
ing: Alcohols (used chiefly in conjunc- 



tion with other solvents), methyl ethvl 
propyl, and amy], methyUamyl ether 
acetic ether, di-ethy]-ketone, methyl* 
ethyl ketone, amyl nitrate and acetate 
nitro-benzole, nitro-toluol, nitrated oils, gla" 
cial acetic acid, camphor dissolved in 
alcohol, etc. 

Some of the above may be called 
selective solvents, i. e., they dissolve one 
particular variety of gun cotton better 
than others, so that solubility in any 
given solvent must not be used to indi- 
cate solubility in another. No nitro- 
cotton is entirely soluble in any solvent 
The solution,_ after standing some time* 
always deposits a small amount of insol- 
uble matter. _ Therefore, in making 
collodion solutions, care should be taken 
to place the containing bottles in a place 
free from vibration and shock. After 
standing a few weeks the clear super- 
natant liquid may be decanted off. On 
a larger scale collodion solutions are 
filtered under pressure through layers of 
tightly packed cotton wool. The state 
of division is important. When the end 
in view is the production of a strong film 
or thread, it is advisable to use unpi-lped 
or only slightly pulped nitro-cellulose. 
In this condition it also dissolves more 
easily than the finely pulped material. 

FULMINATES: 

Fulminating Antimony. — Tartar 

emetic (dried), 100 parts; lampblack or 
ciiarcoal powder, 3 parts. Triturate 
together, put into a crucible that it will 
three-fourths fill (previously rubbed inside 
with charcoal powder). Cover it with a 
layer of dry charcoal powder, and lute 
on the cover. After 3 hours' exposure to 
a strong heat in a reverberatory furnace, 
and 6 or 7 hours' cooling, cautiously 
transfer the solid contents of the crucible, 
as quickly as possible, without breaking, 
to a wide-mouthed stoppered W 
where, after some time, it will s P?" ta " 
neously crumble to a powder. WJl *. n 
the above process is properly conducted, 
the resulting powder contains potassium, 
and fulminates violently on contact WW 
water. A piece the size of a pea intro 
duced into a mass of gunpowder ex- 
plodes it on being thrown into water, 
or on its being moistened in any o 
manner. 

Fulminating Bismuth.— Take bis- 
muth, 120 parts;, carbureted cream 
tartar, 60 parts; niter, 1 part.
