Soluble Extract of Ginger Ala a 
the following three formulas the j Of 
intended for soda-fountain use th 
ond is a "cheap" extract for the bottlS 
who want a one r ounce-to-the-g a ll 0D Z 
tract, and the third is a bottlers' extra! 
to be used in the proportion of thi-3 
ounces to a gallon of syrup. This latter 
is a most satisfactory extract and has 
been sold with most creditable results 
both as to clearness of the finished ginger 
ale and delicacy of flavor. 

It will be noted that in these formulas 
oleoresin of ginger is used in addition to 
the powdered root. Those who do not 
mind the additional expense might use 
one-fourth of the same quantity of vola- 
tile oil of ginger instead. This should 
develop an excellent flavor, since the oil 
is approximately sixteen times as strong 
as the oleoresin, and has the additional 
advantage of being free from resinous 
extractive. 

The following are the formulas:

Hot Lemonade.— Take 2 large, fresh 
lemons, and wash them clean with cold 
Water. Roll them until soft; then divide 
each into halves, and use a lemon-squeez- 
er or reamer to express the juice into a 
small pitcher. Remove all the seeds 
from the juice, to which add 4 or more 
tablespooiifuls of white sugar, according 
to taste. A pint of boiling water is now 
added, and the mixture stirred until the 
sugar is dissolved. The beverage is very 
effective in producing perspiration, and 
should be drunk while hot. The same 
formula may be used for making cold 
lemonade, by substituting ice water for 
the hot water, and adding a piece of 
lemon peel. If desired, a weaker lemon- 
ade may be made by using more water.

KOUMISS. 

The original koumiss is the Russian, 
made from mare's milk, while that pro- 
duced in th ls country and other parts of 
Europe is usually, probably always, made 
from cow s milk. For this reason there 
is a difference m the preparation which 
may or may not be of consequence It 
has been asserted that the ferment used 
in Russia diilers from ordinary yeast but 
this has not been established 

uted hv ^TT °n Sub ^ ect > con *"b- 
ceuL7 R H ", Da y e ^ t0 the Pharma- 
ceutical Journal and Transactions, it i s 

milt ?f? fatty matter than cow's 
milk and he states that it is "therefore 
far more eas y of digestion." H e thinks 
hat cow's milk yields a better pr p ,

Strong bottles are very essential eha.™ 
pagne bottles being frequently used n j" 
the corks should fit tightly i£ fa Cr '* n . d 
almost necessary to use a 'bottling !!f 
Chine for the purpose, and once the <X 
is properly fixed it should be wired down 
Many failures have resulted because \h 
corks did not fit properly, the result beinS 
that the carbon dioxide escaped as 
formed and left a worthless preparation 
It is further necessary to keep the prepa- 
ration at a moderate temperature, andto 
be sure that the article is properly fin- 
ished the operator should gently shake 
the bottles each day for about 10 min- 
utes to prevent the clotting of the casein. 
It is well to take the precaution of rolling 
a cloth around the bottle during the 
shaking process, as the amount of gas 

generated is great, and should the bottle 
e weak it might explode. 
Kogelinan says that if 1 volume of 
buttermilk be mixed with 1 or % vol- 
umes of sweet milk, in a short time 
lively fermentation sets in, and in about 
3 days the w.ork is completed. This, ac- 
cording to the author, produces a wine- 
scented fluid, rich in alcohol, carbon 
dioxide, lactic acid, and casein, which, 
according to all investigations yet made, 
is identical with koumiss. The follow- 
ing practical hints are given for the pro- 
duction of a good article: The sweet milk 
used should not be entirely freed from 
cream; the bottles should be of strong 
glass; the fermenting milk must be in- 
dustriously shaken by the operator at 
least 3 times a day, and then the corK 
put in firmly, so that the fluid will become 
well charged with carbon-di oxide gas, 
the bottles must be daily opened and ax 
least twice each day brought nearl j to 
horizontal position, in order to allow 
carbon dioxide to escape and air to enc , 
otherwise fermentation rapidly c«u ■ 
If a drink is desired strong m C * X ?°Z. 
acid, the bottles, toward the end oi J 
mentation, should be placed witi 
necks down. In order to i p ; TTne \ i

hours; stir up well, and leave for an- 
other U hours. Then beat thoroughly 
together, and pour from jug to jug till 
perfectly smooth and creamy. It is 
now "still" koumiss, and may be drunk 
at once. To make it sparkling, which 
is generally preferred, put it into cham- 
pagne or soda-water bottles; do not 
quite fill them, secure the corks well, 
and lay them in a cool cellar. It will 
then keep for 6 or 8 weeks, though 
it becomes increasingly acid. To ma- 
ture some for driuking quickly, it is as 
Well to keep a bottle or two to start with 
In some warmer place, and from time to 
time shake -vigorously. With this treat- 
ment it should, in about 3 days, be- 
come sufficiently effervescent to spurt 
freely through a champagne tap, which 
must he used for drawing it off as re- 
quired. Later on, when very frothy and 
^cid it is more pleasant to drink if a 
uttle sweetened water (or milk and wa- 
J?) « first put into the glass. Shake 
the bottle, and hold it inverted well into 
™ e tumbler before turning the tap. 
Waving made one lot of koumiss as above 
you can use some of that instead of 
pttermilk as a ferment for a second 
ot, and. so on 5 or 6 times in succession; 
atter which it will be found advisable to 

thf v. again as at first - Ma re's milk is

menting. But perhaps the chief draw, 
back to cow's m k f a ^ uraw 



cow s milk ls that the cream 
separates permanently, whereas that 3 
mare s rzuik will remix. Hence use par- 
tially skimmed milk; for if there is much 
cream it only forms little lumps of butter 
which are apt to clog the tap, or are left 
behind m the bottle. 

Kwass.— Kwass is a popular drink 
among the Russian population of Kun- 
zews, prepared as follows: In a big kettle 
put from 13 to 15 quarts of water, and 
bring to a boil, and when in active ebul- 
lition pour in 500 grams of malt. Let 
boil for 20 minutes, remove from 
fire, let cool down, and strain off. The 
liquid is now put into a clean keg oi 
barrel, 30 grams (about an ounce) of best 
compressed yeast added along with about 
600 grams (20 ounces) of sugar, and the 
cask is put in a warm place to ferment 
As soon as bubbles of carbonic gas are de 
tected on the surface of the liquid, it is 
signal that the latter is ready for bottling 
In each of the bottles, which should b 
strong and clean, put one big raisin, fil 
cork, and wire down. _ The bottU 
should be placed on the side, and in tl 
coolest place available—best, on ic 
The liquor is ready for drinking in froi

Bleaching 

Linen. — Mix common bleaching pow- 
der in the proportion of 1 pound to a 
gallon of water; stir it occasionally for 

3 days, let it settle, and pour it off clear. 
Then make a lye of 1 pound of soda to 
1 gallon of boiling water, in which soak 
the linen for 12 hours, and boil it half an 
hour; next soak it in the bleaching 
liquor, made as above; and lastly, wash 
it in the usual manner. Discolored 
linen or muslin may be restored by put- 
ting a portion of bleaching liquor into 
the tub wherein the articles are soaking. 

Straw. — L— Dip the straw in a solution 
of oxygenated muriatic acid, saturated 
with potash. (C-Tysenated muriate ot 
lime is much cheaper.) The straw | 
thus rendered very white, and its flexi- 
bility is increased. . , 

IL— Straw is bleached by simply ex- 
posing it in a closed chamber to t| 
fumes of burning sulphur. An old nW 
barrel is the apparatus most used tor 
purpose by milliners, a flat stone l> j 
laid on the ground, the sulphur W 
thereon, and the barrel containing m 
goods to be bleached turned ovwb 
The goods should be previously w*

Bleaching Solution. Aluminum h , po- 
cbloridc, or Wilson's bleaching liquid, is 
produced by adding to a clear soluf in of 
lime chloride a solution of aluminum 
sulphate (alumina, alum) as long as a 
precipitate keeps forming- By mutual 
decomposition aluminum chloride re- 
sults, which remains in solution, and 
lime 'sulphate (gypsum), which separates 
out in the form of an insoluble salt.

BLEACHING WATER: 

The most efficient bleaching water and 
also the cheapest to prepare, provided 
you have the facilities, is sodium hypo- 
chlorite, A solution of sodium chloride 
18 subjected to electrolysis. For this 
purpose a source of cheap electric cur- 
rent, such as that provided by abundant 
water power, is necessary. The current 
is all 0W ed to flow until all the salt is con- 
verted into caustic soda at the cathode 
chlorine at the anode. The mixture 
i f se * Wo substances forms sodium 
"ypochlorite which is bottled as is.

should not be used in the boiler. Starch 
substances generally should be avoided. 
Kerosene must be dangerous, as it is 
yery volatile and must soon leave tlie 
boiler and pass over and through the 
engine. , . - 

There are two materials the use ot 
which in boilers is not prohibited through 
action upon the metal itself or on ac- 
count of price. These are soda ash and 
caustic soda. Sodium triphosphate and 
sodium fluoride have both been used with 
success, but their cost is several hundred 
per cent greater than soda ash. If pre- 
scribed as per analysis, in slight excess, 
there should be no injurious results 
through the use of caustic soda and soda 
ash. It would be practicable to manu- 
facture an intimate mixture of caustic 
soda and carbonate of soda, containing 
enough of each to soften the average 
water of a given district. 

There is a great deal of fraud in con- 
nection with boiler compounds gener- 
The better class of venders ad- 
ertise to prepare a special compound for 
special water. This is expensive, save on 
large scale, in reference to a partic- 
ular water, for it would mean a score or 
more of tanks with men to make up the 
mixtures. The less honest of the boiler- 
compound guild consign each sample of 
water to the sewer and send the regular 
goods. Others have a stock analysis 
which is sent to customers of a given 
locality, whether it contains iron, lime, 
or magnesium sulphates or carbonates. 

Any expense for softening water in 
excess of 3 cents per 1,000 gallons is for 
the privilege of using a ready-made soft- 
ener. Every superintendent in charge 
ot a plant should insist that the com- 
pound used be pronounced by competent 




authority free from injurious nvaterkl 
and that it be adapted to the water "' 
use. ln 
Boiler compounds should contain onl 
such ingredients as will neutralize th 
scale-forming salts present. They should 
be used only by prescription, ao m^; 
gallons per 1,000 gallons of feed JJJ 
A properly proportioned mixture of SOr k 
ought to answer the demands of all plants 
depending upon that method of softening 
water in limestone and shale regions. 

The honest boiler compounds are 
however, useful for small isolated plants' 
because of the simplicity of their action'. 
For plants of from 75 to 150 horse power 
two 24-hour settling tanks will answer 
the purpose of a softening system. Each 
of these, capable of holding a day's sup- 
ply, provided with a soci. tank in com- 
mon, and with sludge valves, has pad- 
dles for stirring the contents. Large 
plants are operated on this principle, 
serving boilers of many thousand horse 
power. Such a system has an advan- 
tage over a continuous system, in that 
the exact amount of chemical solutions 
required for softening the particular 
water can be applied. For some varia- 
tions of such a system, several companies 
have secured patents. The fundamen- 
tal principles, however, have been used 
for many years and are not patentable. 

Prevention of Boiler Scale.— The lime 
contained in the feed water, either as bi- 
carbonate or as sulphate, is precipitated 
in the shape of a light mud, but the walls 
of the boiler remain perfectly bright 
without being attacked in any manner. 
While under ordinary atmospheric pres- 
sure calcium chr ornate in solution is pre- 
cipitated by soda or Glauber s salt J 
calcium carbonate or as calcium . aw 
phate; the latter is separated unae 
higher pressure by chromates as calcium 
ch°romate. An excess of chromatej or 
chromic acid does not exercise any a 
terious action upon the metal, n 
the materials used for packing. 3

V. — A method which has wide approval 
for the treatment of water to be used in 
boilers is the following: 

The water to be treated is percolated 
through a silica gel sold under the name 
of "Doucil." This material is capable of 
removing 6 per cent of its weight in lime 
from the water and its valuable feature 
lies in the fact that it can be regenerated 
and used over thousands of times. To re- 
generate it simply percolate brine water 
through it. "Doucil" is a sodium alumi- 
num silicate. 

VI. — A paint for protecting boiler plates 
from scale, and patented in Germany, is 
composed of 10 pounds each of train oil, 
horse fat, paraffine, and of finely ground 
zinc white. To this mixture is added 40 
pounds of graphite and 10 pounds of 
soot made together into a paste with 
1| gallons of water, and about a pound 
°f carbolic acid. The horse fat and the 
zinc oxide make a soap difficult to fuse, 
which adheres strongly to the plates, and 
b "ids the graphite and the soot. The 
Paraffine prevents the water from pene- 
iralmg the coats. The scale which forms 
°n .this application can be detached, it is 
said, with a wooden mallet without in- 
iunng the paint.

josited in a gelatinous sub- 



stance which never adheres to the sur- 
face of the iron plates. The gelatinous 
substances thus formed are nit carried 
with the steam into the cylinder of the 
engine M. Asselin advises the employ- 
ment of 1 pound of glycerine for every 
300 pounds or 400 pounds of coal burnt 
Prevention of Electrolysis. —In order 
to prevent the eating away of the sheets 
and tubes by electrolytic action, it has 
long been the practice of marine engi- 
neers to suspend slabs of zinc in their 
boilers. The zinc, being more suseepti 
ble to the electrolytic action than th 
iron, is eaten away, while the iron re- 
mains unimpaired. The use of zinc ii 
this way has been found also to reduce 
the trouble from boiler scale. Whethei 
it be due to the formation of hydrogen 
bubbles between the heating surfaces 
and incipient scale, to the presence in the 
water of the zinc salts resulting from the 
dissolution of the zinc, or to whatever 
cause, it appears to be a general conclu- 
sion among those who have used it thi " 
the zinc helps the scale, as well as tl 
corrosion. Nobody has ever claimet 
for it that it prevented the attachment 
scale altogether, but the consensus 
opinion is that it ' 'helps some." 

BOILER PRESSURE. 

It hardly pays to reduce pressure 
boilers, except in very extreme eases, but 
if it can be done by throttling before the 
steam reaches the cylinder of the engine 
it would be an advantage, because this 
retains the heat units due to the higher 
pressure in the steam, and the throttling 
has a slight superheating effect. As a 
matter of" fact, tests go to show that tor 
light loads and high pressure a throt- 
tling engine may do better than an auto- 
matic cut-off. The ideal _ arrangemcn 
is to throttle the steam for light - loads, tor 
heavier loads, allow the van a bk j cut-off 
to come into play. This practice > has 
been carried into effect by Ae de^n o 
Mr. E. J. Armstrong, m ^J^J,

For example, in the vast industry ^ 
fugar manufacture, the solutions hrst 
Sde are very dark in co or > a ter hi 
tration through animal charcoal will give 
colorless crystals on evaporatiom Chem- 
ical trades require such large quantities 
of bone charcoal that its production . is 
a large industry in itself. As m breaking 
up the charred bones a considerable 
amount of waste is produced, in the form 
of dust and small grams which cannot be 
used for bleaching purposes, this waste 
should be worked up into a pigment. 
This is done by dissolving out the mineral 
with hydrochloric acid, and then rinsing 
and drying the carbon. 

The mineral basis of bones consists 
mainly of the phosphates of lime and 
magnesia, salts soluble in not too dilute 
hydrochloric acid. A vat is half filled 
with the above-mentioned waste, which 
is then just covered with a mixture of 
equal volumes of commercial hydro- 
chloric acid and water. As the mineral 
matter also contains carbonates, a lively 
effervescence at once ensues, and small 
quantities of hydrofluoric acid are also 
formed from the decomposition of cal- 
cium fluoride in the bones. Now hydro- 
fluoric acid is a very dangerous sub- 
stance, as air containing even traces of it 
is very injurious to the lungs. Hence the 
addition of hydrochloric acid should be 
done in the open air, and the vat should 
be left by itself until the evolution of 
fumes ceases. A plug is then pulled out 
at the bottom and the carbon is thor- 
oughly drained. It is then stirred up 
with water and again drained, when it 
has fully settled to the bottom. This 
rinsing with clear water is repeated till all 
the hydrochloric acid is washed away 
and only pure carbon remains in the vat. 
As for pigment-making purposes it is 
essential that the carbon should be as 
nnely divided as possible, it is as well to 
grind the washed carbon in an ordinary 
color mill. Very little power is required 
tor this purpose, as when once the bone 
earth is removed the carbon particles 
nave little cohesion. The properly 
ground mass forms a deep-black mud, 
which can be left to dry or be dried by 



artificial heat. When dry, the mirifioA 
hone black is of a pure black and S 
a most excellent pigment. Kea 
Bone black is put, upon the mark* 
tinder all sorts of names, such as i V n 
black, ebur ustum, Frankfort black neii 
tral black, etc. All these consist uf 
finely ground bone black puriEed from 
mineral matter. If leather scraps 
dried blood are to be worked up, i ron 
tubes are employed, closed at one ead 
and with a well-fitting lid with a small 
hole in it at the other. As these bodies 
give off large volumes of combustible 
gas during the charring, it is a good plan 
to lead the vapors from the hole by a 
bent tube so that they can be burnt and 
help to supply the heat required and so 
save fueh Leather or blood gives a char- 
coal which hardly requires treatment 
with hydrochloric acid, for the amount 
of mineral salts present is so small that 
its removal appears superfluous. 

BOWES, A TEST FOR BROKEN. 

Place a stethoscope on one side of the 
supposed fracture, and a tuning fork on 
the other. When the latter is vibrated, 
and there is no breakage, the sound will 
be beard distinctly through bone and 
stethoscope. Should any doubt exist, 
comparison should be made with the 
same bone on the other side of the body, 
This test shows the difference in the 
power of conducting sound possessed by 
bone and soft tissue.

H n inch long and a sixteenth of an inch 
broad somewhat resembling a beetle is 
very destructive, and books will be 
found, if left untouched, after a few 
months to have numerous holes in the 
covers and leaves. If this insect be al- 
lowed plenty of time for its ravages it 
will make so many holei that bindings 
originally strong can be easily torn to 
pieces. All damage may be prevented 
by coating the covers of books with the 
varnish described under (3). When 
books are found to contain the insects 
they should be well wrapped and placed 
in the sun before varnishing. 

(3) The appearance of a fine binding

Creosote \ ounce 

Spirit of wine 20 fl. ounces 

Macerate with occasional shaking for 
a few days if wanted at once, but for a

BORAX FOR SPRINKLING-. 

I. — Sprinkling borax is not o 
cheaper, but also dissolves less in solde 
ing than pure borax. 

The borax is heated m a metal ves 
until it has lost its water of crystalhzati 
and mixed with calcined cooking s 
and potash— borax, 8 parts; cooki 
salt, 3 parts; potash, 3 parts, iVext 
is pounded in a mortar into a fine po 
dor, constituting the sprinkling borax. 

II. — Another kind of sprinkling bor 
is prepared by substituting, 8 1 W*' 1 1 
theVtash. GUw-gaJl is the froth floa 
ing on the melted glass, whmh can d 

skimmed off. t , .•_ no 

The borax is either dusted I on m po

Miscellaneous Coloring of Brass — 
Yellow to bright red: Dissolve 2 Tj a ' rt _ 
native copper carbonate with 1 pljl 
caustic soda in 10 parts water. Bin 
a few minutes into the liquor, the Va 
rious shades desired being obtained 
according to the length of time of the 
immersion. Green: Dissolve 1 part cop- 
per acetate (verdigris), 1 part 
vitriol, and 1 part alum in 10 parts of 
water and boil the articles therein 
Black: For optical articles, photographic 
apparatus, plates, rings, screws, etc 
dissolve 45 parts of malachite (native 
copper carbonate) in 1,000 parts of sal 
ammoniac. For use clean and remove 
the grease from the article by pickling 
and dip it into the bath until the coating 
is strong enough. The bath operates 
better and quicker if heated. Should 
the oxidation be a failure it should be 
removed by dipping into the brass 
pickle. 

A verdigris color on brass is produced 
by treating the articles with dilute acids, 
acetic acid, or sulphuric acid, and drying. 

Brown in all varieties of shades is ob- 
tained by immersing the metal in solu- 
tions of nitrates or ferric chloride after 
it has been corroded with dilute nitric 
acid, cleaned with sand and water, and 
dried. The strength of the solutions 
governs the deepness of the resulting 
color. 

Violet is caused by immersing the thor- 
oughly cleaned objects in a solution of 
ammonium chloride. 

Chocolate color results if red ferric 
oxide is strewn on and burned off, fol- 
lowed by polishing with a small quantity 
of galena. 

Olive green is produced by blacken- 
ing the surface with a solution of iron m 
hydrochloric acid, polishing with galena, 
and coating hot with a lacquer composed 
of 1 part varnish, 4 parts cincuma, and I 
part gamboge. . , , 

A steel-blue coloring is obtained 07 
means of a dilute boiling solution 01 
chloride of arsenic, and a blue one ; by » 
treatment with strong hyposulphite 
soda. Another formula for MufflM 
brass is: Dissolve 10 parts of 
chloride in 200 parts of water, a nd ^. aa the 
parts of pure hydrochloric acid. W t

Coloring Fluid for Brass. — Caustic 
soda 33 parts; water, 24 parts; hydraled 
carbonate oE copper, 5.5 parts. 

Dissolve the salt m water and dip the 
metal in the solution obtained. The in- 
tensity of the color will be proportional 
to the time of immersion. After remov- 
ing the object from the liquid, rinse with 
water and dry in sawdust. 

Black Color on Brass. — A black or ox- 
idized surface on brass is produced by a 
solution of carbonate of copper in am- 
monia. The work is immersed and al- 
lowed to remain until the required tint 
is observed. The carbonate of copper is 
hest used in a plastic condition, as it is 
then much more easily dissolved. . Plas- 
tic carbonate of copper may be mixed as 
follows: Make a solution of blue vitriol 
(sulphate of copper) in hot water, and 
add a strong solution of common washing 
soda to it as long as any precipitate 
forms. The precipitate is allowed to 
settle, and the clear liquid is poured off. 
Hot water is added, and the mass stirred 
and again allowed to settle. This oper- 
ation is repeated six or eight times to re- 
move the impurities. AEter the water 
has been removed during the last pour- 
ing, and nothing is left but an emulsion 
of the thick plastic carbonate in a small 
quantity of water, liquid ammonia is 
added until everything is dissolved and a 
dear, deep-blue liquid is produced. If 
too strong, water may be added, but a 
strong solution is better than a weak one. 
« it is desired to make the solution from 
tW m n rc ^ P^ astic carbonate of copper 
P?? following directions may be followed: 
^issolve 1 pound of the plastic carbonate 
°I copper in 2 gallons of strong ammonia,

fr. 



om iso c 



previ 

to 175° F. This solution, if 



^ated too hot, gives off all the ammonia. 



The brass is left m the solution until the 
required tint is produced. The coW 
produced is uniform, blaek, and tena! 
cious. The brass is rinsed Ind dried in 
sawdust. A great variety of effects may 
be produced oy hrst finishing the brass 
before blackening, as the oxidizing proc- 
ess does not injure the texture of the 
metal. A satisfactory finish is produced 
by first rendering the surface of the 
brass matt, either by scratch-brush or 
similar methods, as the black finish thus 
produced by the copper solution is dead 
— one of the most pleasing effects of an 
oxidized surface. Various effects may also 
be produced by coloring the entire article 
and then buffing the exposed portions. 

The best results in the use of this so- 
lution are obtained by the use of the SO' 
called red metals — i. e., those in whicl 
the copper predominates. The reasoL 
for this is obvious. Ordinary sheet brass 
consists of about % parts of copper and 1 
part of zinc, so that the large quantity of 
the latter somewhat hinders the produ< 
tion of a deep-black surface. Yellow 
brass is colored black by the solutioi 
but it is well to use some metal having 
reddish tint, indicating the presence oi 
large amount of copper. The varietif 
of sheet brass known as gilding or bronz 
work well. Copper also gives exceller 
results. Where the best results are d( 
sired on yellow brass a very light electrt 
plate of copper before the oxidizmf 
works well and gives an excellent blacl 
With the usual articles made of yehoi 
brass this is rarely done, but the oxxdf 
tion carried out directly. 

Black Finish for Brass. — I. — A haw 
some black finish may be put on bras 
by the following process: Dissolve u 
1,000 parts of ammonia water 45 parts o, 
natural malachite, and in the solution m

ISO 



To Give a Brown Color to Brass.— I.— 
In 1 000 parts of rain or distilled water 
dissolve 5 par^ each of verdigris (copper 
acetate) and ammonium chloride, x-et 
the solution stand 4 hours, then add 1,500 
parts of water. Remove the brass to be 
browned from its attachment to the nx- 
tures and make the surface perfectly 
bright and smooth and free from grease. 
Place it over a charcoal fire and heat un- 
til it "sizzes" when touched with tne 
dampened finger. The solution is then 
painted over the surface with a brush or 
swabbed on with a rag. If one sjab- 
bing does not produce a sufficient deptn. 
of color, repeat the heating and the ap- 
plication of the liquid until a fine durable 
brown is produced. For door plates, 
knobs, and ornamental fixtures gener- 
ally, this is one of the handsomest as well 
as the most durable surfaces, and is 
easily applied. 

II. — A very handsome brown may be 
produced on brass castings by immersing 
the thoroughly cleaned and dried articles 
in a warm solution of 15 parts of sodium 
hydrate and 5 parts of cupric carbonate 
in 100 parts of water. The metal turns 
dark yellow, light brown, and finally 
dark brown, with a greenish shimmer, 
and, when the desired shade is reached, 
is taken out of the bath, rinsed, and dried. 

HI. — Paint the cleaned and dried sur- 
face uniformly with a dilute solution of 
ammonium sulphide. When this coat- 
ing is dry. it is rubbed over, and then 

{tainted with a dilute ammoniacal so- 
ution of arsenic sulphide, until the 
required depth of color is attained. 
If the results are not satisfactory the 
painting can be repeated after washing 
over with ammonia. Prolonged im- 
mersion in the second solution produces 
a grayish-green film, which looks well, 
and acquires luster when polished with 
a cloth. 

Refreshing Gas Fixtures. — Gas fix- 
res which nave become dirty or tar- 
ished from use may be improved in ap- 
earance by painting with bronze paint 
nd then, if a still better finish is re- 
uired, varnishing after the paint is 
thoroughly dry with some light-colored 
arnish that will give a hard and brilliant 
oating. 

If the bronze paint is made up with 
rdinary varnish it is liable to become 
discolored from acid which may be pres- 
ent in the varnish. One method pro- 
posed tor obviating this is to mix the 
varnish with about five times its volume 
ot spirit of turpentine, add to the mixture 
dried slaked lime m the proportion of 



about 40 grains to the pint, agitate m , 
repeating the agitation several times ar!l 
finally allowing the suspended matter tn 
settle and decanting the clear linrnli 
The object of this is to neutralize a ™ 
acid which may be present. To deter 
mine how effectively this has been done 
the varnish may be chemically tested. 

Steel Blue and Old Silver on Br ass _ 
For the former dissolve 100 parts of ear- 
bonic carbonate in 750 parts of ammonia 
and dilute this solution with distilled 
water, whereupon the cleaned articles 
are dipped into the liquid by means of a 
brass wire. After two to three minutes 
take them out, rinse in clean water, and 
dry in sawdust. Old silver on brass is 
produced as follows: The articles are 
first silvered and next painted with a thin 
paste consisting of graphite, 6 parts; 
pulverized hematite, 1 part; and tur- 
pentine. Use a soft brush and dry well; 
then brush off the powder. Oxidized 
silver is obtained by dipping the silvered 
goods into a heated solution of liver of 
sulphur, 5 parts; ammonia carbonate, 10 
parts; and water,10,000 parts. Only sub- 
stantially silvered objects are suited for 
oxidation, as a weak silvering is taken 
off by this solution. Unsatisfactory col- 
oring is removed with potassium-cya- 
nide solution. It is advisable to lay the, 
articles in hydrogen sulphide-ammonia 
solution diluted with water,wherein they 
acquire a blue to a deep-black shade. 

Tombac Color on Brass. —This is pro 
duced by immersion in a mixture of cop 
per carbonate, 10 parts; caustic soda, W 
parts: water, 200 parts. This layer will 
only endure wiping with a cloth, not vig- 
orous scouring with sand. 

Graining of Brass.— Brass parts of 
timepieces are frequently provided wita 
a dead grained surface. For this pur- 
pose they are fastened with flat-headed 
pins on cork disks and brushed witnj 
paste of water and finest P° wd .ff r a 
pumice stone. Next they are taorj 
oughly washed and placed in a swutkj 
of 10 quarts of water, 30 grains of rag 
curie nitrate, and 60 grains ot suJP" 
acid. In this amalgamating s0 ' u H th 
the objects become at once coverea arT , a l. 
a layer of mercury, which forms an i 
gam with the copper, while tne g 
passes into solution. After the » r te j 
have again been washed they are i q{

more the dish and brush are turned. 
When the right grain is attained, rinse 
off with water, and treat the object with 
a scratch brush, with employment of a 
decoction of saponaria. .The brushes 
must be moved around in a circle in 
brushing with the pumice stone, as well 
as in rubbing on the graining powder 
and in using the scratch brush. Ihe 
required silver powder is produced by 
precipitating a diluted solution of silver 
nitrate with some strips of sheet copper. 
The precipitated silver powder is washed 
out on a paper filter and dried at moder- 
ate heat. 

The Dead, or Matt, Dip for Brass.— 

The dead dip is used to impart a satiny 
or crystalline finish to the surface. The 
bright dip gives a smooth, shiny, and per- 
fectly even surface, but the dead dip is 
the most pleasing of any dip finish, and 
can be used as a base for many secondary 
finishes. 

The dead dip is a mixture of oil of 
vitriol (sulphuric acid) and aqua fortis 
(nitric acid) in which there is enough 
sulphate of zinc (white vitriol) to saturate 
the solution. It is in the presence of the 
sulphate of zinc that the essential differ- 
ence between the bright and the dead dip 
exists, "Without it the dead or matt sur- 
face cannot be obtained. 

The method generally practiced is to 
a dd the sulphate of zinc to the mixed 
a cids (sulphuric and nitric), so that some 
remains undissolved in the bottom of the 
vessel. It is found that the sulphate of 
zinc occurs in small crystals having the 
a PPearance of very coarse granulated 
sugar. These crystals readily settle to the 
bottom of the vessel and do not do the 
£ork of matting properly. If they are 
Dn ely pulverized the dip is slightly im- 
proved, but it 'is impossible to pulverize

precipitation, and in the dead dip it is 
very important hat * ne sulphate of zinc 
shall be finely d'wded so that it will no" 
immediately settle to hebottcm. Ther 
fore it should be precipitated so that 
when it is mixed with the acids it will not 
settle immediately. The method of mak- 
ing the sulphate of zinc directly in the 
solution is as follows: 

Take 1 gallon of yellow aqua forti 
(38° F.) and place in a stone crock 
which is surrounded with cold water 
The cold water is to keep the hea 
formed by the reaction, from evaporatin 
the acid. Add metallic zinc in sma 
pieces until the acid will dissolve n 
more. The zinc may be in any conve - 
ient form — sheet clippings, lumps, era 
ulated, etc., that may be added little b 
little. If all is added at once it will bo 
over. "When the acid will dissolve n 
more zinc it will be found that some 
the acid has evaporated by the heat, an 
it will be necessary to add enough free 
acid to make up to the original gallo 
When this is done add 1 gallon of strong 
oil of vitriol. The mixture should b 
stirred with a wooden paddle while th 
oil of vitriol is being added. 

As the sulphuric acid is being add 
the solution begins to grow milky, a 
finally the whole has the consistency 
thick cream. This is caused by the s 
phuric acid (oil of vitriol) precipitati 
out the sulphate of zinc. Thus the ve 
finelv divided precipitate of sulphate 
zinc'is formed. If one desires to u 
known quantities of acid and zinc t 
following amounts may be taken, un 
vitriol, 1 gallon; aqua fortis (38 £*h

f nd a ffie S' M re oiltf vitriol gives 
°I ta t while a larger q-^ty f

Xn the oip "beeves old it is unneces- 
sary to add more zinc, as a little goes into 
fhfsofution each time anything is dipped. 
After a while, however, the solution be- 
comes loaded with copper salts; and 
should be thrown away. 

A new dip does not work well, and 
will not give good results when used at 
once It is usual to allow it to remain 
over night, when it will be found to be in 
a better working condition in the morn- 
ing. A new dip will frequently refuse to 
work, and the addition of a little water 
will often start it. The water must be 
used sparingly, however, and only when 
necessary. Water, as a usual thing, 
spoils a dead dip, and must be avoided. 
After a while it may be necessary to add 
a little more aqua fortis, and this may be 
introduced as desired. Much care is 
needed in working the dead dip, and it 
requires constant watching and experi- 
ence. The chief difficulty in working 
the dead dip is to match a given article. 
The only way that it can be done is to 
"cut and try," and add aqua fortis or oil 
of vitriol as the case requires. 

The dead or matt dip can be obtained 
only upon brass or German silver; in 
other words, only on alloys which con- 
tain zinc. The best results are obtained 
upon yellow brass high in zinc. 

To Improve Deadened Brass Parts. — 
Clock parts matted with oilstone and 
oil, such as the hour wheels, minute 
wheels, etc., obtain, by mere grinding, a 
somewhat dull appearance, with a sensi- 
tive surface which readilv takes spots, 
lliis may be improved by preparing the 
following powder, rubbing a little of it 
on a burr slick and treating the deadened 
parts, which have been cleansed with

of cooking salt, and 10 parts of tpaV 
tar with 250 parts of nitric acid a 
afterwards add 250 parts of sulphS 
acid; or else mix 7 parts of aqua fort' 
(nitric acid) with 10 parts of English 
sulphuric acid. For the mixing ratio of 
the acid, the kind and alloy of the metal 
should be the guidance, and it is best 
found out by practical trials. The bet 
ter the alloy and the less the percentage 
of zinc or lead, the handsomer will be 
the color. Genuine bronze, for instance 
acquires a golden shade. In order to 
give brass the appearance of handsome 
gilding it is often coated with gold var- 
nish by applying same thinly with a brush 
or sponge and immediately heating the 
metal over a coal fire. 

Pickling Brass to Look Like Gold.— 
To pickle brass so as to make it resem- 
ble gold allow a mixture of 6 parts of 
chemically pure nitric acid and 1 part of 
English sulphuric acid to act for some 
hours upon the surface of the brass; then 
wash with a warm solution, 20 parts of 
tartar in 50 parts of water, and rub off 
neatly with dry sawdust. Then coat 
the article with the proper varnish. 

Pickle for Dipping Brass.— To im- 
prove the appearance of brass, tombac, 
and copper goods, they are usually 
dipped. For this purpose they arc first 
immersed in diluted oil of vitriol (brown 
sulphuric acid), proportion, 1 to 10; next 
in a mixture of 10 parts of red tartar; iu 
parts of cooking salt; 250 parts ol Eng- 
lish sulphuric acid, as well as 250 parts or 
aqua fortis (only for a moment), ringing 



oft well in water and drying w sa J v, „ ol(i

For obtaining a handsome matt gel 
color part of zinc vitriol (zinc sw 
phate) is still added to the pickle.
