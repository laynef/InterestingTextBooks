wr irers have provided us with tiny 
/ fitted with lenses of enormous 
eaB °- e «fv and exquisite defining power, 
ra ? rnilfilms of such quality, speed and 
aD , cmtsitivity as were undreamed of 
?° l0t n ? predecessors, that the intelligent 
? fnner starts level, as far as the at- 
tSent of technical excellence is con- 



cerned" with the advanced worker of 

^hrrS'nner differs only in this: he 
. Ihnlous in his aspirations; he lacks 
l h e n frSc training It the pictorialist ; 

d he is reluctant to learn the funda- 
mentals of photography. 

General and appealing advantages are 
the compactness, portability, and self- 
containedness of these miniature cam- 
eras. 

Within the space of a few square 
inches the photographer can carry at all 
hues, in a soft pocket purse or in an 
ever-ready case slung from the neck, a 
fullv equipped instrument furnished 
with a single roll of film for twelve, 
sixteen or thirty-six exposures without 
reloading and ready for instant use. 

The facility of immediate operation is, 
however, of practical value only when a 
camera is so optically endowed as to 
make the registration of the subjeet 
effectively on the film, irrespective of 
prevailing light conditions, Tegardless of 
the rapidity with which the subject is 
moving, and in despite of the amount 
of depth of field definition the photogra- 
pher desires. 

Fot this purpose the lens must possess 
great light-passing power; so it must be 
of very large aperture ; and it must _ at 
the same time have great depth of criti- 
cal definition in order that planes before 
and behind the principal object focussed 
sharply, shall be rendered recognisable 
in reasonably big enlargements. 

Good depth of definition and great 
lens rapidity are, however, incompatible 
unless the focal length of the lens is 
short. Hence, these two indispensable 
qualities can be secured in the miniature 
camera only, which is equipped as a 
standard with a lens of five or six 
centimetres focal length and of nominal 
rapidity F3.E, F2.9, and F2. 

With even this last aperture a satis- 
factory depth of field can be secured 
Without stopping down, thus allowing 
sateen times the light intensity at the 
surface as that given by a lens 
forking at F8. 



This advantage of miniature cameras 
under conditions where the utmost light 
action must be secured in photograph- 
ing rapidly moving objects when the 
illumination is far from brilliant needs 
no stressing. 

In the matter of running costs, once 
the user has mastered the operating of 
the camera and is able to handle it with 
the certainty that comes of practice, the 
expense is small, the cost of each nega- 
tive being little more than 2 cents as- 
suming the use of higher priced films 
and including the cost of developing and 
fixing them. 



MODERN HIGH-SPEED FILMS 
AND SOME OF THEIR SPE- 
CIAL CHARACTERISTICS: 

Verichrome— Highly sensitive to 
greens and yellows, almost approaching 
panchromatic in this respect. Excellent 
'for skies and clouds and portraits of 
dark persons. Ideal for photograph* 
including naked lights. 

Selochrome. — A fine film for genert 
miniature work. For portraits of verj 
fair people, when used with a pale light 
filter, gives excellent color values. 

Agfa Isochrom.— One of the bes 
films for good contrast on dull days an 
in winter. Develops quickly. 

Zeiss Ikon, Mimosa and Perutz Fi 
GraL— Specially advantageous ft 
Spying and where large commercial ai 
technical prints are wanted.

IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT 
LENSES: 

Lens F3.5 with 2 inch Focal Length. 
—For general, all around photography, 
sufficiently rapid, exquisite definition, al- 
lows of enlargements to any practical 
"imensions. 
Wide angle lens F3.5 with 3.5 centi- 
eters focal length. Useful for interiors, 
confined situations, architectural suo- 
'ects in narrow streets. 

Lens F1.9 with 73 mm. Focal 
enffth —Valuable for very large heads 
tage and night snapshots. The image 
iven by this lens possesses a fine "soft- 
harp" quality when taken with full 
perture, particularly effective in por- 
rait work. 

Lens F6.3 with 4 inch Focal Length, 
not telephoto type). — A useful lens for 
Ipine and other mountainous regions. 
Light in weight and gives a more im- 
osing rendering of distant mountains 
(four times the area) than standard 2 
ch lens. 

Lens F4.5 with 13.5 centimeters 
ocal Length (not telephoto type).— A 
le long focus supplement lens for dis- 
'ance, sports pictures and groups. Defi- 
ition at full aperture very good. 

Lens F2, with 5 centimeters Focal 
ength. — This lens gives most remark- 
ble definition at its full aperture, ram- 
ming enormous speed with absolutely 
eedly sharp definition over the whole 
egative area. Invaluable where very 
ig enlargements must be made from 
egatiyes taken under difficult lighting 
onditions and requiring rapid exposures. 

Lens F4.5 with 13.4 centimeters 
Focal Length. — This lens, similar in ap- 
plication to the 13.4 centimeter lens, has 
a greater resolving power than the latter. 
It has been designed for infra-red pho- 
tography of distant scenes and for 
archaeological and architectural work 
demanding the keenest definition and 
detail in the small negatives. In con- 
junction with Perutz fine grain film the 
negatives yielded seem to have no limit 
in enlarging, the magnification can be 
taken so high as to reveal the grain, 
even in the fine grain films, without 
losing the image structure. 

Lens F3.4 and F2.8.— For general 
photography. It is unnecessary to re- 
mark on the perfect correction and 



needle-sharp defining quality of thia 
famous lens. Lenses F2 and F1.5 with 
2 inch focal length are not inferior to 
this lens in correction and definition 
Their high speeds are valuable for night 
photography and when stopped down, 
they are as good as this F3.4 and F2.8 
lenses for general work. 

Lens F4 with 354 inch Focal Length 
— A useful medium long focus lens for 
big heads and general indoor and studio 
portraiture. Rapid enough for high 
speed work at 1/1000 second when one 
cannot approach closely to the per- 
formers. 

Lens F4 with 5% inches Focal 
Length— A rapid long focus lens, par- 
ticularly useful for high speed sports 
work in securing a large image on the 
film from the spectators' enclosure. As 
a supplementary lens for general narrow 
angle pictures like street groups, while 
keeping well distant from ones subjects, 
this lens is highly desirable as supporting 
the regular 2 inch lens. Since it gives an 
image equivalent in view angle to a 15 
inch focal length telelens on a % plate 
reflex, its value will be self-evident. 

The lens F3.4 and F2.8 has a sliding 
mask which can be brought in front of 
the finder lens, and which then shows a 
facsimile of the reduced view falling on 
the film when the 5% lens is in use. 

Lens F6.3 with 7 inch Focus.— This 
lens, equivalent in use to a 20 inch tele- 
lens on a % plate will be found useful 
for photographing distant villages from 
mountain heights and conversely for big- 
scale snapshots of mountain climbers 
taken from the ground. 

When using lenses of 5 inches or longer 
focal length, it is always best, whenever 
possible, to support the camera on^ a 
tripod ; this obviates vibration and ^ in- 
sures the correct placing of the subject 
on the film. A slight movement of the 
camera when the normal lens is em- 
ployed may not cut off any essential part 
of the subject. When a "long focus lens 
is in use, the image moves much more 
rapidly as the camera is moved, and the 
loss of some important feature may easily 
occur, unnoticed. 

If the camera must be held in the 
hands the fingers should firmly support 
the lens mounting, a fairly rapid speed 
be dialed, and a careful observance of 
the finder image should be maintained 
until the exposure has been made.

Lens IMg inch Focal Length.— Valu- 
able for interiors and confined situations. 
The remarkable exquisite defining power 
of the lens has been recognized and 
a Ppreciated, as well as its covering 
power over a very -wide angle, for many 
years. 



F3.4 and F2.8 negatives made with 
this lens, using Zeiss Ikon special fine 
grain film, will stand an almost 
incredible degree of enlargement. 

The F3.4 and F2.B and the 1^ inch 
focal length will slip into the pocket, and 
15 by 12 enlargements from negatives 
taken with a 15 by 12 stand camera and 
a 12 inch W.A. Anastigmat. 

Architectural enthusiasts and com- 
mercial photographers can produce, with 
the miniature equipment just mentioned, 
results that can stand up to the best 
work produced in bygone days, with 
heavy and ponderous outfits. 

The Eastman Kodak Company of 
Rochester has an assortment of high- 
speed lenses to fit all the requirements 
of the small miniature cameras. And 
the full range of lenses they have will 
efficiently cover the subjects and work 
already outlined by the writer. 

After you have studied over the infor- 
mation regarding lenses already related 
by the writer, it will act as a guide in 
the purchase of your next camera or 
lens. 

HOW TO PRINT PICTURES ON

for about two minutes. A photoflood 
lamp requires a slightly longer exposure. 

The process described above has been 
used in printing pictures on the pages of 
a book without detaching the leaves or 
pages from the book. If the photograph 
o made is to be exposed to light very 
uch, it should be swapped over lightly 
ith a piece of absorbent cotton and a 
ypo solution (1 ounce of hypo to 3 
unees of water). 

OW TO ENLARGE PICTURES 
DIRECT ON WALLBOARD OR 
WALLS OF THEATRES AND 
TAVERNS: 

The walls of the theatre or tavern that 
e picture is to be projected upon 
hould be in good condition as to the 
laster. Cracks should be filled with 
laster of Paris or a patching plaster 
and allowed to dry several days before 
any of the following operations are 
begun. Before applying the sensitizer, 
the wall must have a primary coating of 
isoluble gelatin. This is made by 
llowing y a pound of hard gelatin to 
oak in one gallon of water for 30 
mtes. The mixture is then heated to 
temperature of 130° P. and 2 drams 
f carbolic acid are added to the mix- 
re. This mixture is then painted on 
he walls and allowed to dry. Some 
ecommend spraying the mixture on the 
all and if too thick to operate in A 
prayer, thin it by adding an equal 
mount of warm water and then giving 
■wb coats, allowing the first to dry 
efore applying the second. 

When the coating is dry, a solution of

sprayed or washed on the wall. This

Application of the sensitizer must be 
done in dim red light or total darkness. 
AVhen it has begun to set or dry, the 
image is projected upon it from the 
enlarger. The length of exposure de- 
pends upon the size of the negative used 
and the size of the finished print. A 
negative of normal density, size 8 x 10 
inches may be enlarged to about 12 feet 
in length and will take about 18 minutes 
of exposure. It is a good idea to have 
the image already focussed upon the 
wall before the sensitizer is applied. 

Developing is done by spraying th e 
sensitized area with the developer given 
previously for Copv and Process nega- 
tives. It is a good idea to dilute the 
developer somewhat so that the action 
will be slowed enough for control. Should 
the image show signs of over-developing* 
spray it quickly with a solution of glacial 
acetic acid 4 ounces mixed in one gallon 
of water. This stops the developing-

MISCELLANEOUS FORMULAS 
REVERSAL OF THE IMAGE: 

Following the development and after a 
short washing in running water, immerse 
the plate in a dish-containing 8 ounces 
of the reversing solution and take the 
dish out in full light. The plate which 
was opaque, clears, and the colors 
hecome more and more visible by trans- 
mitted light. After half or one-and-a- 
half minutes, when the plate bears no 
more trace of negative image, take it out 
of the dish and wash it for about 30 
seconds in running water. 

Reversing Solution. — 

Potassium . , 30 grains 

permanganate .... (2 grams) 

Sulphuric acid 3 drams 

(10 cubic centimeters j 

Water 35 ounces 

(1000 cubic cen- 
timeters) 

This solution will keep for a short 
time, but should not be used if cloudy. 

Immediately the plate is covered by 
the solution daylight may be used. 

Second Development.— The plate ^ is 
then re-developed in full daylight, using 
the solution which has served for the 
first development, (kept in the dish with- 
out special precautions). When the 
highlights are completely darkened 
(about 3 or 4 minutes) the plate is 
hashed for 8 or 4 minutes, and imme- 
diately placed to dry. Fixing is m- 
lecessarv unless the plate is intensified. 



Ground-Glass Varnish. — 

Sandarac 90 grains 

(103 grams) 

Mastic 20 grains 

(23 grams) 

Ether (0.720) 2 ounces 

(1000 cubic cen- 
timeters) 

Dissolve the resins in the ether and 
afterwards add 

Benzole % to l"Vs ounces 

(250-T50 cubic 
centimeters) 
The proportion of the benzole added 
determines the nature of the matt 
obtained. 

This varnish must be applied to the 
cold negative or the coating will not 
matt. 

Retouching Medium. — 

Pale gum resin . . . 200 grains

They arc then rinsed and rapidly dried 
With a fan or by means of a jet of com- 
pressed air, which drives the water away, 
The printing may be .effected by the 
bitumen or the bichromated albumen 
process, but with a few modifications. 
In order that an image may be used 
efficiently as a lithographic resist, it must 
be formed of greasy ink incorporated 
with the stone or metal, and not merely 
held in some way on its surface. When 
the printing has been carried out by the 
bitumen process, it is then necessary^ to 
replace the bitumen by greasy ink 
everywhere and yet without any en- 
croachment over the parts corresponding 
to the whites of the image, in which the 
metal must remain bare. For this pur- 
pose, after development of the bitumen 
print, rinsing and rapid drying, the 
metal is covered with a somewhat thick 
solution of gum freshly prepared (to 
which may be added an aniline dye which 
will enable its application to be more 
easily controlled), and this is dried as 
quickly as possible. When the gum is 
completely dry, the plate is washed with 
benzene, which dissolves the bitumen, and 
is rolled with stone-to-stone retransfer 
ink thinned to a liquid consistency with 
turpentine. The solvent is allowed to 
evaporate, and the plate is washed with 
water to re-dissolve the gum, which has 
completely protected the underlying 
metal from any contact with the ink. 
The image being now formed of greasy 
ink, the "etching" and the gumming of 
the metal may be proceeded with. 

Printing by the albumen process as 
usually practised does not lend itself to 
photo-metallography, as the compara- 
tively thick coating of insolubilized albu- 
men completely isolates the greasy ink 
from the metal. 

The solution of albumen must be as 
dilute as possible, while yet permitting 
the image to be developed without diffi- 
culty; on coarse-grained metal it is, 
however, necessary to use a slightlv more 

concentrated solution. A few prelimin-

on of lavender':::;;;;;;; } 



For use this ink must be thinned with 
benzene or turpentine, but the latter 
must have been freshly manufactured. 

Immediately after development, the 
metal must be flushed with a freshly pre- 
pared 20 per cent solution of gum arabic 
the surplus of which is removed with a 
wet rag, and the plate is then dried 
rapidly. After this drying, or at any 
rate within one hour at most, after which 
time the ink would already be too hard 
to enable the operations to be proceeded 
with under satisfactory conditions, the 
following "washing-out mixture" is ■ 
spread over the image so as to cover it 
evenly, but without any unnecessary 
excess: 

Turpentine 40 parts 

Litho writing ink .... 1 part 
Powdered bitumen ... 2 parts 

The solvent is now allowed to evapo- 
rate, the thin film of ink which formed 
the original image meanwhile dissolving 
in the turpentine and forming a new ink, 
which being very greasy and fluid, has 
been able to penetrate down to the metal 
through the very thin coating of albumen, 
and to give a firm seating to the image. 
After the greasy liquid is completely dry, 
the gum is moistened with a wet rag, the 
plate is rolled up with ordinary litho- 
graphic ink, then the metal is "etched," 
gummed again, and dried rapidly with a 
fan. 

WHAT ARE PERCENTAGE 
SOLUTIONS? 

The usual practice in making a solu- 
tion to a specified percentage strength is 
to consider the weight of the substance 
to be dissolved in relation to the volume 
of the completed solution. Thus, to make 
a 10 per cent solution, we dissolve 1 
ounce avoirdupois in enough water to 
make the volume of the solution 10 fluid 
ounces. If, however, the object is to 
make a solution of which some sub-divi- 
sion of a fluid ounce will contain a grain 
or an exact number of grains, then the 
number of minims or drachms of the 
completed solution must be an exact 
multiple of the number of grains _ dis- 
solved. Thus if 1 ounce avoirdupois of 
437.5 grains be dissolved in enough 
water to make the volume of the solu- 
tion 4,375 minims (approximately 9 
ounces 1 drachm) every 10 minims of the 
solution will contain grain of the sub- 
stance.

A simple device can be made at home

Secure a box, or make one (20 mches

and turn handle to hold two spools. 
From the left hand corner, the film will 
travel up to another small roller, 6 inches

top-the film then travels 8 inches across 
the box onto another small roller, and 
from there, down to the empty spool m

Between the two top small rollers, a 
hole is cut in the top of the box, and a. 
small paper cylinder inserted (about & 
inches long) and the same size as your 
film (16 millimeter or 32 millimeter). A 
small 25 'watt reflected bulb is fitted. 
OUTSIDE the box, so as it will sboW 
light for the printing to be effected, 
through the paper cylinder. 

Before printing, the positive roll of 
Wm and the exposed film has to be re 
'wound onto the ONE spool. Use a 
little film cement to make sure that tne 
films will not "slide", and be sure that 
both films have an equal grip onto tne 
^pty spool you are to Tewind onto. 

Once these spools are wound together, 
all there has to be done is to treadle tne 
double film from the full spool up onto 
tbe small roller across the "light cyl- 
inder" over the other small roller and 
down to the empty spool. 



Two complete revolutions per second 
is about the speed for average negatives 
(slower if dense, and slightly faster if 
flat or weak negative roll has to be 
used) . 

The steps in the process comprise 
vigorous development of the negative 
image; chemically removing the silver; 
washing the roll with only enough light 
to deliberately under-expose the remain- 
ing silver halide positive image, so as 
to permit a partial positive image and 
separately flashing each of the scenes 
with the additional amount of light such 
that the partial positive image of each 
of the scenes visibly indicates the neces- 
sity for the desired intensification, ano" 
then submitting the roll to final develop 
ing and finishing operations. 

These operations are carried out in a 
series of tanks. One tank is designed to 
permit the undeveloped negative cine 
film to receive a vigorous negative de- 
veloper bath of approximately 12 
I minutes' duration in order to fully bring 
out the negative image. This and sub- 
sequent baths are preferably at 68° F. 

A preferred formula for the bath in 
tank 10 is

The film is again rinsed and then 
travels under a definite under-exposure 
light-source at the approximate speed of 
twenty feet per minute. It is important 
that this exposure be limited to approxi- 
mately Sixty candle-meter seconds, which 
will at this point assure a deliberate and 
definite under-exposure to commercial 
cinema film, The purpose of this step 
is to guard against any possibility of 
subsequently over-exposing any scenes 
that were badly exposed in the camera. 

In the next tank, the film receives a 
partial positive developer bath of 
approximately one minute in duration, 
viz. : 

Potassium ferrocyanide. 32 grains 

(3.7 grams) 

Metol 2Vi grains 

(0.25 gram) 

Soda sulphite 135 grains

(21.1 grams) 

Sodium nitrite . . 4^2 grains 

(0.5 grams) 

Water, to make . . 20 ounces 

(1000 cubic 
centimeters) 

The object of this bath is to partially 
develop the latent partial positive image 
previously under-exposed in the preced- 
ing step. 

The film next emerges from this tank 
nd passes over the safelight, the light 
f which is transmitted through the film 
to enable the operator to observe the 
scene as it passes before him. At this 
oint, the operator flashes each scene 
with an additional amount of light that 
the visual inspection of the scene indi- 
cates as desirable to bring up its in- 
tensity. r 

The film then re-enters the re-de- 
veloper tank and re-emerges where it 
passes over another safelight. At this 
point the operator again observes each 
of the scenes as it passes before him, 
and again flashes each scene with a final 
hicrement of light as each scene indicates 

S„ iTv able f ° r its intensification. It 
Should be noted here that there is a 
possibility that some scenes may now

inL?« .-° r t0 give each sce »e the 
intensification it requires, thereby 



properly compensating not only for the 
original exposure in the camera, but also 
for the central point of interest in eacQ 
scene. 

Next the film may pass through an- 
other tank, where it is treated with a 
positive re-developer bath for approxi^ 
mately seven minutes. The formula of 
the solution in this tank is preferably the 
same as that previously used. 

The film next passes through a fourth 
rinsing bath. 

The film then passes through a fixing 
bath for approximately five minutes. A 
formula for this bath is as follows; ■ 

Hypo 4, ounces 

(200 grams) 

Sodium sulphite 90 grains 

(10 grams) 

Glacial acetic acid .... 1% drams 

(10 cubic 
centimeters) 

Chrome alum 175 grains 

(20 grams) 

Water, to make 20 ounces 

(1000 cubic 
centimeters) 

The process up to this point is carried 
on in a suitable safelight. From this 
point the process may be conducted in 
white light. The film is next thoroughly 
washed. 

RECOVERY OF SILVER FROM 
OLD HYPO SOLUTIONS: 

The price of silver has increased 60 
per cent in the last three months, and 
the amount of silver thrown away in old 
hypo solutions is more than interesting, 
"it's serious," and a waste of money. 

Here is a simple formula for the 
recovery of silver from hypo. To throw 
down the silver from waste hypo baths, 
liver of sulphur is used. The chemical is 
dissolved to a strong solution and is 
added to the hypo baths which have been 
allowed to accumulate to the bulk of, say 
20 to 30 gallons, in a wooden cask. As 
the solution is added, the hypo is stirred 
vigorously with a flat piece of wood, as 
long as a dark precipitate is thrown 
down. With acid baths there is the 
foul smell of sulphuretted hydrogen, 
though this can be largely prevented by 
adding caustic potash or caustic soda 
solution along with the liver of sulphur. 
Even if the caustic is added, the opera- 
tion should be carried on outdoors. The 
sludge of silver sulphide is given a day 
or two to settle thoroughly, the clear 
liquor is then run off with a' siphon tube

MAKING NEW PHOTOS FROM 
OLD AND FADED ONES: 

First clean the print by rubbing it 
gently, yet firmly, with a tuft of cotton- 
wool. It is surprising to find what a lot 
of fine dust and dirt can be got off an 
old print in this way. A room with a 
good large window should be selected, 
and the print fixed up flat against the 
wall, so that the window light falls 
nearly perpendicularly on the print. If 
a sidelight be used, the negative will 
probably show a lot of tiny cracks which 
the eye has not noticed. These crack- 
marks will show unpleasantly in the 
print copy. 

The camera should be set up so that 
the lens is opposite the center of the 
P«nt, and the ground glass truly verti- 
cal- To facilitate focussing, tear from 
a newspaper a strip of bold print half an 
inch wide and, say, a foot long, and pin 
this diagonally across the face of the 
P™it. It i S f ar easier to see when such 
jype matter is in focus than when a pho- 
tographic print is in focus. Use the larg-

It will now be clear that a good deal 
depends on giving just enough exposure 
to get good strong density in the plain 
paper parts of our print; anything 
beyond this is detrimental, inasmuch as 
it means a reduced chance of securing 
the very faint or faded yellow details of 
the original picture. 

HOW TO COPY CRACKED 
PRINTS: 

In order to copy a print which is 
covered with minute cracks, a good plan 
is to rub powdered chalk into the cracks 
before the copy is made. If the copy 
negative is afterwards enlarged, it is 
possible to spot out even the most 
minute cracks, which will appear white 
in the enlargement. The chalk, if lightly 
rubbed in, will not injure the print, and 
can be brushed out when it has served 
its purpose. 

RETOUCHING: 

Negatives which have been re- 
touched" in the professional sense can- 
not be enlarged. Retouching is seldom 
Squired however, in amateur work, 

pecially if the negatives are made^n 
a panchromatic emulsion, and are tuny 
e^csed. Under-exposure is the came of 
the need for nine-tenths of tne Tetu

a convenient angle with the light behind 
it. A large printing frame, with a piece 
of glass in it, will often serve, and on 
the glass may be put a piece of card to 
support the negative on its top edge. A 
irood quality H pencil is the best to use, 
and this 'should be most carefully 
sharpened to a very long fine point. The 
tip should be an inch or more from 
the commencement of the paper. Fine 
emery paper is useful to give the last 
touch to the lead point. When the 
medium has become sufficiently dry, we 
may place the negative on its support, 
and then proceed to work upon it, 

The precise nature of the pencil- 
stroke in retouching must be left to the 
taste of the worker. The easiest plan I 
have always found is to make short, fine 
lines side by side. In fact, it resolves 
itself into delicate, but not "niggly" 
shading. There should be no attempt to 
get a lot of lead on in any one place by 
using a soft pencil or exerting any pres- 
sure, as this will result either in remov- 
ing the medium or in breaking the point. 
Stippling a series of dots will often 
serve; while some photographers work 
with a fine circular movement of the 
pencil, taking it off as little as possible, 
making a continual series of minute 
rings, keeping the pencil on the negative 
and always on the move, running lightly 
from one little defect to another, filling 
in thin places, blending all the harsh 
lights and darks, until the effect desired 
has been obtained. It is a good plan to 
start retouching by taking a negative of, 
say, some foliage which is a little in- 
clined to appear spotty, and endeavour- 
ing, by the use of the pencil, to make the 
more transparent parts of the negative 
print lighter, so that the spottiness is 
less pronounced. Not only is it excel- 
lent practice, but such an application of 
retouching is more likely to be useful to 
the amateur photographer than is its 
employment in portraiture, which calls 
for other skill and knowledge than the 
mere ability to darken a light patch to 
the depth of its surroundings. If the 
medium does not seem able to take all 
the pencil we would like to put on, it is 
not a sign that it has been improperly 
applied, but that we are trying to add 
to J n . uc t . The mere st trace of lead is 
sufficient, if the negative is not over- 
uense. 

The amateur retoucher had better 
begin by using an exteremely hard lead 
pencil, such as HHH or HHHH being 
perhaps the most suitable, and the point 
should be sharpened in the following 



manner: — The pencil point should always 
be kept very sharp by rubbing on fine 
emery paper- Now touch the abraded 
surface over the pinhole in a circular 
manner till the hole is no longer visible. 
It is as well after several pinholes have 
been retouched to take a print from the 
same to see whether they show or not. 

Instead of the cuttle-fish advised 
above, any of the following retouching 
varnishes may be used. They can be 
applied with the finger-tip or a wad of 
cotton-wool direct to the film side of the 
negative without any other preparation. 
Do not use too much — a little goes a 
very long way; just a smear is sufficient.

In retouching portraits, it is not how 
much one may do to a negative, but how 
little; not crowding the lead on, but 
placing it just where the least work will 
give the most effect. 

There is no particular kind of stroke 
to learn that will enable one to become a 
retoucher, but just where there is a line, 
freckle or mark, or whatever the defect 
may be, carefully fill that part so that 
it comes even with the surrounding part, 
and that kept up gradually will be found 
to result in a nice "grain" in retouching 
talk, or stipple, as others call it. Dur- 
ing the progress of the work occasionally 
look at the negative reversed, sitting well 
back, taking a general survey of it, and 
where the work looks patchy, blend the 
patches into each other.

A™ him his correct title "the 
thnr" This rule, like most others, is 
S c t to exceptions, of which the case 
oFportrHiture comes first. If a visit is 
made to the studio of a professional 
photographer for the purpose of having 
a portrait taken, on the usual terms of 
payment for a number of copies, the 
copvright belongs to the sitter and not 
to the taker; but, notwithstanding this, 
the sitter cannot demand from the 
photographer the negative from which 
the prints were made, as the implied 
contract is simply for a number of 
prints, and the negative remains the 
property of the photographer, His 
rights in it are not of much value to 
him because he can be restrained from 
selling the prints to illustrated papers, 
or dealing with the negative in any way 
except for the use of his customer. 

Now this only applies to cases where 
the sitter pays the photographer. If 
there is no payment, no matter whether 
the photographer is an amateur or a pro- 
fessional, both the copyright in the 
photograph and the property in the 
negative belong to him and he can do as 
he pleases providing it is not to the dis- 
advantage of the sitter. 

The other important exception to the 
Hie that the copyright belongs to the

not copyright laws, at the present time. 
Certain countries of the world have

copyright in one of these countries gives 
copyright protection to the rest of the 
countries of the Union. These countries 
forming the Union agreed to this at a 
convention at Berlin in 1908. The fol- 
lowing countries aTe in this Union: 
Great Britain, France, Germany, Bel-

Switzerland, Norway, Portugal, Japan,

this Union are the United States, Aus- 
tria, and Russia,' but it is possible for 
non-American owners of copyright to 
have protection in the United States by 
separate registration. This also applies 
to a certain extent to other countries not

semi-dry and then tacked back on to the 
frame. 

You now have an exact reproduction 
of the subject with all its half-tones and 
shadows. Now it is only a matter of 
"filling in" with oils and the resulting 
picture is true to life. 

The same process can be applied to 
oil-paintings for silk, satins, suede, vel- 
vets, etc., or on to polished wood, ivory, 
leather, etc. 

PHOTOGRAPHY IN 
NATURAL COLORS 
Natural color photography is some- 
thing that is now passing into a reality, 
and high prices are paid for photos in 
natural colors. 

In making color photos one must 
understand that a negative in natural 
colors must be obtained first and there 
are several ways of doing this. 

A natural color "one shot" camera can 
be purchased or if the camera fan is 
handy with tools he can build himself 
one. Another manner which, is the more 
popular, is to buy a roll of natural color 
films (either the Dufray or Eastman's 
Kodacolor). These films arc loaded into 
any ordinary camera and the picture 
taken in the usual manner, only an addi- 
tional 25 per cent has to be added to all 
the normal exposures, unless you trade 
in your present lens for a faster one. 
This is because color films are not as 
quick as the ordinary orthochromatic. 

These films are developed in a revers- 
able developer (see elsewhere in this 
book) and then fixed and allowed to dry 
in the usual manner. The next step is to 
get the natural color film image on paper 
so as it can be viewed by reflected light 
(like an ordinary photo). The film is 
placed in an ordinary printing frame and 
three prints taken from it onto panchro- 
matic film. But each film has to be 
filtered so that each film will contain the 
color it requires and the colors not re- 
quired will be "stopped" by the action of 
the filter used. 

These filters are sold by all photo and 
kodak stores. You need red, blue and 
green. Make sure you buy filters the 
same size as your films. The green filter 
J« used to make red film, the blue filter 
tor the red film and the red filter is 
used for the yellow film. If four color 
natural plates are needed, you make four 
Wms using the yellow filter for the 
black nlate. 



These red, blue and green films are 
printed on stripping film and toned i n 
the colors colled for, and when these 
very thin stripping films are laid on 
paper, one on top of another, a natural 
color photograph is the result. 

After you have printed the three films 
through their respective filters (giving 
them the exposure you will find marked 
on the film box called "film factors") 3 
these films are developed in the usual 
manner and allowed to dry. While they 
are drying it is advisable to prepare the 
paper that you will need later on. Take 
a piece of ordinary azo photographic 
paper and place it in hypo (without ex- 
posure or development). After fixing 
wash well and allow to dry. 

When the separated color films are dry, 
contact each of these films on a good 
grade of stripping paper (The Defender 
Company manufactures a fine grade of 
stripping paper which can be purchased 
from any Kodak store). Contact these 
strip films in the same way as you do 
ordinary paper, develop (M.Q.) fix and 
wash. When these films are well washed, 
they are toned in the red, blue and yel- 
low toners. Being careful to tone the 
red film that you used the green filter 
on, and continue as previously outlined. 

W T hen the three stripping films are 
toned, they arc squeeged on the piece of 
azo paper, first the yellow, then the blue, 
and finally the red. That only makes 
three colors. But where the photograph 
runs from high lights into deep shadows, 
the reds may cross the blues and the re- 
sult will be many delightful shades of 
lavender or deep violets, either finishing 
in deep reds or dense blue. 

The fourth plate, black, is never used 
except when making natural color photo- 
graphs for the metal engravers. This 
black "plate" is then used for outlining. 

There is another way of making nat- 
ural color plates with colored films. Or- 
dinary panchromatic films may be used 
in a "studio, and the filters are placed 
over the camera lens and three films can 
be shot in this manner one after the 
other. However, one has to be careful 
to see that the camera is well fastened 
to the floor and that nothing is moved 
while the three plates are being made. 
As little as a 64th of an inch would ruin, 
foT when you placed your toned picture 
over each other they "would not register- 
When the three-toned strip films are 
squeeged on top of each other, the tare 
primary colors you used in toning tn ^ 
strip films will, in turn, give about seve 
or eight different colors.

negatives are not printed eac^Yn ™ 
same color asthe filter through which 
it was exposed, and why, in fact, they 
coIom printed in exactl y opposite 

First, let it be clearly understood that 
the finished color print is built up, so to 
speak, of three positive images super- 
imposed, one on top of the other. Each 
of these images is in a different color 
and each is a reproduction of the amount 
of that color which showed in the orig- 
inal subject. Now let us remember that 
the light which hits the filter in front of 
the lens is divided into two parts, one 
part being absorbed by the filter and the 
other passing through the lens to the 
plate. Let us call for the moment these 
two parts "absorbed color" and "trans- 
mitted color." It is "transmitted color" 
which reaches the plate and causes the 
negative image, afterwards developed. 
It is obvious that a positive print made 
from this negative would reproduce the 
subiect in light and shade exactly ac- 
cording to the amount of "absorbed 
color" in the subject. This then, is the 
color in which the negative must be 
printed. Therefore, the negative must 
bT printed in the color complementary 
to the filter.

REFERENCE DICTIONARY OF PHOTOGRAPHIC CHEMICALS 

AND THEIR USES 



Acetic Acid. — A volatile liquid, having a strong odor of vinegar. When con- 
centrated (glacial) is corrosive. It is a solvent for gelatin, celluloid, and pyroxy- 
line, and when used as a constituent of photographic baths, must therefore be present 
only in a very small proportion. Usually as a 28 per cent solution. This is made from 
glacial acid by mixing three parts of acid with eight parts of water. Used to acidify 
fixing and toning baths. Keep in a glass stoppered bottle. 

Acetone. — A colorless inflammable liquid, has an odor of ether. It is soluble 
In all proportions in water, alcohol, and ether. It is an excellent solvent for fats 
resins, and celluloid. Used in conjunction with amyl acetate to make negative 
varnishes. A solution of collodion in acetone used as a varnish gives a matte surface. 

Albumen. — The dried white of eggs. An exceedingly complex organic com- 
pound of carbon and hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur. Swells in cold water 
and dissolves to form a thick solution. It is used in the preparation of albumenized 
paper as a substratum in process work and for sensitizing zinc plates in photo 
etching. 

Alums, Potassium, Potassium Chrome, and Ammonium. — All soluble in cold 
and hot water. Used in fixing baths as a hardener and clearer to prevent stains. 
Chrome alum is the most efficient. Also used in some toners. 

Amidol. — One of a group of isomeric compounds, five of which are developers. 
Supplied as a powder, varying in color from white to dark grey. Keeps well in 
owder form if kept dry, but in solution deteriorates rapidly. Never mix more 
than is to be used at once as it quickly turns to a dark brown liquid which stains 
the hands and prints. Gives nice blaek tones when used as a developer. Used in 
tropical developers. 

Ammonia. — A water-like liquid of pungent smell. Used in emulsion making, 
and in pyro developer for making warm toned lantern slides. Used in the fixing 
bath for platinum printing. Also very good for stripping the emulsion from old 
Tates and films. 

Ammonium Bichromate. — Orange red crystals, similar to potassium bichromate. 
Used in making halftones on zinc and copper as a sensitizer for albumen or fish glue. 

Ammonium Bromide. — Coarse white powder or crystals, very soluble. Used 
as restramer in developers and as an ingredient in bromide emulsions. 

Ammonium Carbonate. — Comes in white lumps that are soluble in water. Used 
ui pyro and other developers for making warmer tones. Should not be dissolved in 
hot water. 

Ammonium Chloride.— This is sal ammoniac, a white crystalline powder, very 
soluble and somewhat hygroscopic. Used in preparing chloride emulsions, salting 
printing papers, and with bichloride of mercury for making bleaching baths. Used 
in fixing and toning baths for chloride papers.

ble in water powerful alkali that neutralizes acids. Used as an accelerator i n 
develoners and for setting warm tone lantern slides and plates. Must he used weak 
or it will frill the emulsions. Used with warm or hot water for stripping negatives 
or old plates. 

Caustic Soda, Sodium Hydroxide.— Comes in white stick like the potash and 
fe similar in action and has about the same strength in solution. 

Cellulose— A material from which paper, pyroxyline, celluloid, and the flexible 
transparent films are made. All motion picture films and professional films are 
made from cellulose. It is a natural constituent of all fibers and woody plant stems. 

French Chalk— A very fine white or greyish powder used for polishing glass 
surfaces, upon which photographic prints are to be squeegeed for glazing. 

Citric Acid. — Clear crystals or powder, unstable in solution with water, decom- 
posing in contact with air into acetic and carbonic acid. Used as the acid constitu- 
ent of clearing or acid fixing baths, and as a preservative for developers and 
emulsions. Can be substituted for acetic acid in some formulas. 

Chloroform (Trichloromethane). — A colorless heavy mobile liquid, only slighty 
soluble in water, entirely soluble in alcohol. Dissolves fats and resins, and is used 
for making encaustic pastes for photoprints. 

Chrome Alum —See Alums. 

Copper Chloride. — Green-blue crystals, poisonous. Used in negative reduc- 
tion, and also in emulsions for contrast. Also used in toners and carbon sensitizers. 

Copper Sulphate (Bine Vitriol). — Comes in large blue crystals or greenish 
white powder. Poisonous. Used for toning and bleaching, and for intensification 
in process printing. 

Sensitizing Dyes. — These dyes are used to increase the emulsion's sensitivity to 
different colors of light. The use of these dyes determines the amount of ortho- 
chromatism or panchromatism of the emulsion. The commonest are: Eosin, ery- 
throsine, cyanin^ diocyanin, ethyl red, rose bengal rhodamine, pincyanol, and 
pinachrome. 

Ferric Ammonium Citrate. — A light sensitive salt. Comes in brown pearl crys- 
tals or in the form of green scales. The latter is more sensitive to light and is 
preferable for photographic use. Deliquescent, 

Ferric Chloride. (Iron Perchloridc), — Yellow red opaque mass or lumps. De- 
liquescent. Used to reduce overexposed negatives, in blue and green toning baths, 
and for etching copper plates in photo -en graving. 

Ferric Oxalate (Iron Sesquioxalate) . — Comes either in dark greenish scales or 
m brown crystals. Extremely light sensitive. The manufacture of this chemical is 
difficult and it has been practically withdrawn from the chemical catalogues. It is 
very unstable, and will not keep under any conditions. Was used in old time 
methods of photography but has been displaced by silver bromide and chloride. It 
is soluble in water. 

reducer*^ Sulphate ~ Emerald £ reen Crystals. Soluble in water. Used as a 

Ferrous Ammonium Sulphate.— Clear green crvstals. More stable than ferrous 
sulphate and lias displaced it in many uses. Used in ferrous oxalate developer.

as oils, waxes, solvents, plasticizers ana 
lubricants to give the desired properties 
of elasticity, toughness, strength and 
heat resistance as may be demanded by 
the particular plastic which is com- 
pounded and also to improve the mold- 
ing process. Among tbe fillers arejsuch 
substances as cotton flock, wood flour, 
asbestos fibre, clay, silica, mica and 
other mineral fillers together with pig- 
ments to give the mass the desired color. 

A composition suitable for plastic 
molding must be so compounded that an 
ultimate and homogeneous mixture of the 
ffl ter and binder is obtained. To this 
end various types of machines are used, 
^ as Wading and dough mixing ma- 
chines, rubber rolls, powder mixers to 
JJ e <* the thorough conglomeration ot 
tne binder and filler which Is obtained 



either in the form of a powder or sheets 
or cake form. These are usually ground 
in suitable grinders or disintegrators and 
screened to obtain graded powders or 
else cut up in small preforms to be fed 
to the die. In many eases the powder ia 
fed to a preforming press which gives 
off simple geometrical forms which may 
after be used to feed in the die to obtain 
the final article. 

Plastics are usually subdivided into 
classes with reference to the nature of 
the binder employed: — 

Compositions from Proteins, — Pro- 
teinous compounds such as blood albu- 
men, gelatin, glue, casein, beer yeast, 
sea weeds and egg albumen are used 
quite frequently in the compositions to 
act as binders for sawdust, asbestos, talc, 
chalk and vegetable fibres. These com- 
positions in many cases are hardened by 
immersing in a formaldehyde bath and 
then drying. 

I.— 25 parts of sawdust are mixed with 
150 parts of chalk and to it added 45 
parts of gelatin and 10 parts of glue 
previously dissolved in water; the ma- 
terial is mixed in water and molded. 
Colors may be added,

V. Ernolith is a composition made 

from beer yeast treated with formalde- 
hyde mixed with a filler and pressed in 
a hot mold at 180° F. 

VI. A composition for doll's heads is 

made by dissolving 8 parts of glue and 
1 part gum arabic in 12 parts of water 
at about 200° F. To this is added 12 
parts paper pulp and the mass is stirred 
rapidly. Whiting is then added to give a 
mass dense enough to be molded. The 
objects are then allowed to dry in the air 
and finally at a gentle heat after which 
the surface may be impregnated with 
oil, resins, waxeSj and lacquered. 

Plastic Masses from Bitumens, Oils 
and Resins. — These products are mainly 
used in the manufacture of heat-resistant 
compositions, electrical insulation and 
battery boxes. 

I. — A hard rubber substitute is made 
by melting 35 parts of Trinidad asphalt 
with an equal amount of stearine pitch. 
To this is added 4 parts of powdered 
sulfur and the material is heated for 2 
hours at a temperature of 340° F. to 
vulcanize. 

II. — A composition for electrical in- 
sulation is made by dissolving 2 parts of 
pitch from coal-tar distillation in 1 part 
of heavy coal-tar naphtha and mixing 
with equal parts of asbestos fibres to 
give a plastic powder which is molded 
under pressure into the desired forms 
and afterwards hardened by baking for 
24 hours at 400° F. 

III. — A composition for battery boxes 
may be made by melting 100 parts of 
gilsonite with 10 parts of raontan wax, 
sufficient wood flour and cotton flock 
may be added to give a pasty mass 
which is pressed while hot in cold dies 
to give the desired article. 

^Y'^A- composition suitable for cold- 
molding may be made by mixing 10 
Parts of linseed oil with 10 parts of pe- 
troleum asphalt, 6 parts rosin and 74 
parts filler such as fine asbestos fibres 
lne materials are mixed in a kneading 
machine to give a powdery conglomerate 
which is afterwards pressed in a closed

Plastic Masses From Synthetic Res 
ins. — Phenolic-formaldehyde Condensa- 
tion products may be made by reacting i 
molecular weight of phenol with I txioIq. 
eular weight of formaldehyde in the 
presence of a catalyst. Such a resin mav 
be prepared by mixing 50 parts of phenol 
with 30-60 parts of 40 per cent formalde- 
hyde and adding 2-8 parts of ammonia 
water 15 per cent strength. The ma- 
terial is gently heated with steam in a 
jacketed kettle until a solid is obtained 
which is very friable and still fusible. 
The resin is then poured oif in shallow 
trays and continued heating in an oven 
preferably under vacuum until it no' 
longer fuses but is still elastic when hot. 
At this stage the resin is pulverized and 
incorporated in the various ways with 
wood flour or asbestos and pigments to 
give a powder which after being worked 
on the rolls is ground and then ready for 
molding in a hot die into the required 
shapes. 

Plastics from Inorganic Materials.— 
I. — Sodium silicate (waterglass) may be 
used to bind wood flour or other fillers 
which may then be molded under pres- 
sure to obtain hard objects. 

II. — A composition suitable for mold- 
ing into various shapes may be made by 
mixing 20 parts lime with 40 parts of 
fine silica and 40 parts of asbestos fibres, 
setting into a plastic dry powder which 
may be molded under pressure. The 
mass is then hardened by subjecting to 
the action of steam in an autoclave at 
125 pounds pressure. 

III. — Another formula calls for 50 
parts Portland cement, 20 parts asbestos 
fibres, 10 parts water, 10 parts pigment. 
The materials are thoroughly mixed, 
molded and then coated with a solution 
of gum arabic to give a gloss. 

IV. — Artificial stones may be made by 
mixing Portland cement with asbestos 
fibres and adding vegetable fibres, 

V. - — A magnesia cement composition 
is made by mixing thoroughly 72 parts 
of freshly calcined magnesite with 22 
parts Epsom salt, and 5 parts of lead 
acetate. The whole is mixed dry and 
water added to give a plastic powder 
which may he molded under pressure to 
give the object desired.

STAINS — VARNISH 



FROM 



STAINS, REMOVAL OF 
MARBLE; 

(The following has been derived from 
a publication By the Bureau of Stand- 
ards.) 

Tobacco Stains.— An excellent for- 
mula for removing tobacco stains from 
marble is the following: Dissolve 2 
nounds of trisodium phosphate crystals 
| 1 gallon of hot water. Mix 12 ounces 
of chlorinated lime to a paste m an 
enameled pan by adding water slowly 
and stirring. Pour the two solutions 
into a stoneware jar and add water until 
about 2 gallons are obtained. Stir thor- 
oughly, cover the jar and permit the 
lime to settle. Add some of the liquid 
to powdered talc until a thick paste is 
formed and apply a layer % inch thick 
with a trowel. To apply with a brush 
instead, add about one teaspoonful ot 
sugar to each pound of powdered talc. 
If working on polished marble, scrape 
off with a wooden paddle; if dull mar- 
ble, scrape off with a trowel. This mix- 
ture is a strong bleaching agent and 
corrodes metals, hence care must be ex- 
ercised to prevent its dropping on metal 
fixtures or colored fabrics. 

Pire Stains. — The marble may have 
been discolored from smoke or pitch 
from burning wood. Scour the surface 
with powdered pumice to remove any 
surfaee deposit, then make up a solution 
of trisodium phosphate and chlorinated 
lime as outlined under Tobacco Stains. 
Fold a white Canton flannel cloth so as 
to form three or four layers and saturate 
it in the liquid. Paste this on the stain 
and cover with a piece of glass or a 
scrap slab of marble, make sure that the 
cloth is pressed closely against the mar- 
ble. Resaturate the cloth as many times 
as is necessary. 

Iodine Stains. — This stain will disap- 
pear by itself in a few weeks time. 
However if it is desired to remove it 
quickly the following is recommended: 
Apply alcohol and cover with whiting or 
talcum powder. For vertical wall stains, 
mix the talcum to a paste with alcohol, 
apply some alcohol to the stain and 
cover with the paste. Normally, one 
application is usually sufficient. 

Perspiration Stains— Use same 
method as for Are stains. T5ad stains 
may require several treatments. 



Urine Stains. — Use same method as 
for tobacco stains. If some of the stain 
is difficult to remove, saturate a layer 0 f 
cotton batting in the liquid and "paste 
over the spot. Repeat if necessary. 

TUNG, OR CHINAWOOD OIL 
COOKING: 

Raw Chinawood oil gives on drying a 
crystallized film which is unsuited for 
paint and varnish manufacture. 

Before using in paints, Chinawood oil 
should be carefully cooked, thereupon it 
will give a smooth, flexible -film. Heat 
the oil quite rapidly to 500-510° P. and 
then cool to 425-435°, keep at this tem- 
perature until the desired string is ob- 
tained, then cool at once, either by water 
or other means. In the event a thinner 
is added this temperature may be 
checked by the thinner. Care must he 
taken in cooling so that the oil does not 
jell. Driers or resins may be added if 
required. 

VARNISH FORMULAS INVOLV- 
ING THE USE OF SYNTHETIC 
RESINS: 

Phenolic Resin.— There are a large 
number of phenolic resins on the market 
which have been modified to meet special 
requirements. They are usually com- 
pounded with glyceryl phthalate, ester 
gum or natural resins. The manufac- 
turer of varnishes should consult with 
the resin producer to insure using the 
correct resin for his particular purpose. 

Phenolic Resin 100 pounds 

Chinawood oil 25 gal bus 

Kettle bodied linseed oil 8 gallons 

Mineral spirits 35 gallons 

Add cobalt and manganese drier. 
Heat the chinawood oil with the phe-

WATERPROOFING, WALL 
(EXTERIOR): 

Paraffin wax dissolved in volatile sul- 
vents is considered to he very efficient. 
For finer pore walls the addition of 
small amounts of fatty oil is suggested. 
This treatment will produce discolora- 
tions of an oily appearance. The melt- 
'ng-polnt of the wax should be high 
enough to prevent its flow during the 
summer months. Usually wax having a 
melting point of 135° F. is suitable. 

The Caffall process for waterproofing 
*alls is often used where durability is 
the prime requisite; the cost is some- 
what higher than that of various other 
^ethods. The process consists of pre- 
heating the walls and then applying 
' Molten paraffin. This process may be 
Used on damp walls. 



There are many other means that are 
also recommended. An inexpensive mix- 
ture which is reported as being very 
durable is the following: 

6 to 12 ounces high melting-point 

paraffin dissolved in 
1 gallon of solvent 

The solvent may be naphtha, gasoline 
or the like. The above formula is not 
suited for structures that have fine 
pores; the addition of 3 to 6 ounces of 
chinawood oil to the gallon of solvent 
will yield a satisfactory solution for ap- 
plication to fine-pore walls. 

The waterproofing treatments should 
be applied only when the walls are dry 
and clean and in warm weather. It is 
advisable to continue the application of 
the solutions until there is no further 
absorption — this will* likewise insure 
maximum penetration. Undue discolora- 
tions may be avoided by the removal of 
excess wax after concluding the treat- 
ment. 

Another well known method, Ran- 
some's process, is also used. This 
process consists in filling the pores of 
the stone with potassium or sodium sili- 
cate and permitting to dry, next a coat 
of calcium chloride is applied (using a 
different brush). Care must be taken to 
avoid dropping the solution on windows 
or painted surfaces. 

WOOD PRESERVATION: 

Creosote Oil. — Creosote oil is an ef- 
fective aS economical wood preserya- 
*e which also provides protec ion 
acainst wood-destroying inserts. It gives 
a g brown stain, penetrates deeply and 
Protects the inner wood as well as the
