strained before mixing them together, 
because the arriving at the proper hue ot

If the liquid or mass has assumed a 
brown or brownish color after, being 
heated, arsenic is present m the pigment 
or fabric, etc. , 

An effective but simple test for the 
durability of a color is to paint strips ot 
thick paper and nail them on the wall in 
the strongest light possible. A strip of 

Eaper should then be nailed over one- 
alf of the samples of color so as to pro- 
tect them from the light. On removing 
this the difference in shade between the 
exposed and unexposed portions will be 
very apparent. Some colors, such as 
the verrnilionettes, will show a marked 
difference after even a few weeks. 

Testing Body Colors for Gritty Ad- 
mixtures. — The fineness of the pow- 
dered pigment is not a guarantee of the 
absence of gritty admixtures. The latter 
differ from the pigment proper in their 
specific gravity. If consisting of metallic 
oxides or metallic sulphides the sandy 
admixtures are lighter than the pigments 
and rise to the surface upon a syste- 
matic shaking of the sample. In the 
case of other pigments, e. g. } aluminas 
and iron varnish colors, they collect at 
tne bottom. For carrying out the test, a 
jmoothlv bored metallic tube about J 
to i inch in diameter and 6 to 7 inches 
long is used. Both ends are closed with 
screw caps and at one side of the 
Hi^\ 01ne h °J cs about * of ^ inch in

necessar T samples have been 



collected m this manner, they must , 
prepared with a sUndard sample, whi.k 
is accomplished either by feeling the nn 
der between the fingers or by mspecti!'"" 
it under a microscope, or else by m** 
of the scratching test, which last 
is the usual way. The requisites f 
these scratch tests consist of two soft" 
well-polished glass plates (34 x2| iacheo 
which are fixed by means of ceuient i 
two stronger plates of hard wood sxnt 
ably hollowed out. The surface of tU 
glass must project about £ inch over the 
wooden frame. If a sample of the m B 
ment powder is placed on such a gl^ 
plate, another plate is laid on top and 
both are rubbed slowly together; this 
motion will retain a soft, velvety charac- 
ter in case the pigment is free from" 
gritty admixtures; if otherwise, the glass 
is injured and a corresponding sound 
becomes audible. Next the powder is 
removed from the plate, rubbing the 
latter with a soft rag, and examining 
the surface with a microscope. From tlie 
nature of the scratches on the plate the 
kind of griLty ingredients can be readily 
determined. _ The human finger is suffi- 
ciently sensitive to detect the presence of 
gritty substances, yet it is not capable qI 
distinguishing whether they consist of im- 
perfectly reduced or badly sifted grains 
of pigment or real gritty admixtures. 

To Determine the Covering Power of 
Pigments. — -To determine the covering 
power of white lead, or any other pig- 
ment, take equal quantities of several 
varieties of white lead and mix them 
with a darker pigment, black, blue, etc., 
the latter also in equal proportions. The 
white lead which retains the lightest 
color is naturally the most opaque. l n 
a similar manner, on the other hand, tne 
mixing power of the dark pigments can 
be ascertained. If experiments are 
made with a variety of white lead or 
zinc white, by the admixture of dark pig- 
ments, the color which tints the wAite 
lead or zinc white most, also possess . 
the greatest covering or mixing power. 

To Detect the Presence of AnihjK sjj 
a Pigment.— Lay a little of the co i° f 
upon letter paper and pour a dr0 jj: rie 
spirit on it. If it is mixed with an 
the paper is colored right through « ^ 
by, while a pure pigment does not

Vegetable oil, S to 20 pounds; saponified

Frankfort Black. — Frankfort black, 
also known as German black, is a name 
anplied to a superior grade of lamp- 
black In s° me districts of Germany 
it is said to be made by calcining wine 
lees and tartar. The material is heated 
in large cylindrical vessels having a vent 
in the cover for the escape of smoke and 
vapors that are evolved during the proc- 
ess When no more smoke is observed, 
the operation is finished. The residuum 
in the vessels is then washed several times 
in boiling water to extract the salts con- 
tained therein and finally is reduced to 
the proper degree of fineness by grinding 
on a porphyry. 

Paris Green.— Emerald or Paris green 
is rather permanent to light, but must 
not be mixed with pigments containing 
sulphur, because of the tendency to 
slacken when so mixed. It will not re- 
sist acids, ammonia, and caustics.

PLANTS: 

Temperature of Water for Watering- 
Plants. — Experiments were made sev- 
eral years ago at the Wisconsin Agri- 
cultural Experiment Station to determine 
whether cold water was detrimental to 
plants. Plants were grown under glass 
and in the open field, and in all cases 
the results were similar. Thus, coleus 
planted in lots of equal size and vigor 
were watered with water at 35°, 50°, 65°, 
and 86° F. At the end of 60 days it was 
impossible to note any difference, and 
when the experiment was repeated with 
water at 32°, 40°, 70°, and 100° P., Ihe 
result was the same. Beans watered with 
water at 32°, 40°, 70°, and 100° F., were 
equally vigorous; in fact, water at 32° 
and 40° P. gave the best results. Lettuce 
watered with water at 32° P. yielded 
slightly more than the other lots. From 
these experiments it was concluded that 
for vegetable and flowering plants com- 
monly grown under glass, ordinary well 
or spring water may be used freely at 
any time of the year without warming.

Solution of Rubber in Fixed Solvent- 
Petrolatum and Incorporation with Lead 
Acetate.— India rubber dissolves, though 
with difficulty, in petrolatum. The heat 
required to melt the rubber being Com , 
rjaratively high, usually considerably 
more than 212° F., as stated in the 
U, S. R-> it is necessary to melt the rubber 
first and then add the petrolatum, i n 
order to avoid subjecting the latter to the 
higher temperature. The mixture 0 f 
equal parts of rubber and petrolatum is 
of a soft jelly consistence, not especially 
adhesive, but when incorporated with 
the lead oleate furnishes a very adhesive 
plaster. While at first 5 per cent of each 
rubber and petrolatum was used, it has 
been found that the petrolatum would 
melt and exude around the edges of the 
plaster when applied to the skin, and the 
quantity was therefore reduced to 2 per 
cent of each. This mass affords a plas- 
ter which is readily adhesive to the body, 
does not run nor become too soft. Plas- 
ters spread on cloth have been kept for 
months exposed to the sun in the sum- 
mer weather without losing their stabil- 
ity or permanency. 

The lead oleate made by the inter- 
action of hot solution of soap and lead 
acetate, thoroughly washed with hot 
water, and freed from water by working 
the precipitated oleate on a hot tile, is 
much to be preferred to the lead plaster 
made by the present official process 1 &e 
time honored method of boiling litharge, 
olive oil, and water is for the requirements 
of the pharmacists most tedious and un- 
satisfactory. Since in the beginning « 
the process, at least, a temperature mg«*- 
than that of 212° F. is required, the VM| 
bath cannot be employed, and in tos 
sence of this limiting device the pw»y 
usually "scorched."" When the «£ggj 
under pressure can be used this ooj 
does not apply. But the boiling F Qf 
requires from 3 to 4 hours, witn J» ^ 
less attention, while the prec p ^ m 
method does not take over ha if a to ob . 
Besides, true litharge is drf hc ^ ice un-

Court Plaster or Sticking Plaster.— I. 
— Brush silk over with a solution of isin- 
glass, in spirits or warm water, dry and 
repeat several times. For the last ap- 
plication apply several coats of balsam 
of Peru. This is used to close cuts or 
wounds, by warming and applying it. 
It does not wash off until the skin par- 
tially heals. 

II. — Isinglass, 1 part; water, 10 parts; 
dissolve, strain the solution, and gradu- 
ally add to it of tincture of benzoin, 2 
parts; apply this mixture gently warmed, 
by means of a camel's-hair brush, to the 
surface of silk or sarcenet, stretched on a 
frame, and allow each coating to dry 
before applying the next one, the appli- 
cation being repeated as often as neces- 
sary; lastly, give the prepared surface a 
coating of tincture of benzoin or tincture 
of balsam of Peru. Some manufacturers 
apply this to the unprepared side of the 
plaster, and others add to the tincture 
a few drops of essence of ambergris or 
essence of musk. 

III. (Deschamps). — A piece of fine 
ttuslin, linen, or silk is fastened to a flat 
board, and a thin coating of smooth, 
stramed flour paste is given to it; over 
this, when dry, two coats of colorless 
gelatin, made into size with water, 
Quantity sufficient, are applied warm, 
kaid to be superior to the ordinary court 
plaster. 

Coloring of Modeling Plaster. — I. — If 
Burnt gypsum is stirred uo with water con- 



taining formaldehyde and with a little 
alkali, and the quantity of water necessary 
tor the induration of the plaster contain- 
ing in 3 ? lutl0n a reducible metallic salt is 
added thereto, a plaster mass of perfectly 
uniform coloring is obtained. The hard- 
ening of the plaster is not affected there- 
by. According to the concentration of 
the metallic salt solutions and the choice 
of the salts, the most varying shades of 
color, as black, red, brown, violet, pearl 
gray, and bronze may be produced. 
The color effect may be enhanced by 
the addition of certain colors. For the 
production of a gray-colored gypsum 
mass, for example, the mode of pro- 
cedure is as follows: Stir 15 drachms of 
plaster with one-fourth its weight of 
water, containing a few drops of formal- 
dehyde and a little soda lye and add 10 
drops of a one-tenth normal silver solu- 
tion, which has previously been mixed 
with the amount of water necessary for 
hardening the gypsum. The mass will 
immediately upon mixing assume a 
pearl-gray shade, uniform throughout. 
In order to produce red or copper-like, 
black or bronze-like shades, gold salts, 
copper salts or silver salts, bismuth 
salts or lead salts, singly or mixed, are 
used. Naturally, these colorings admit 
of a large number of modifications. In 
lieu of formaldehyde other reducing 
agents may be employed, such as solu- 
tions of sulphurous acid or hydrogen 
peroxide with a little alkali. Metals in 
the elementary state may likewise be 
made use of, e. g., iron, which, stirred 
with a little copper solution and plaster, 
produces a brown mass excelling in 
special hardness, etc. This process of 
coloring plaster is distinguished from the 
former methods in that the coloration is 
caused by metals in the nascent state and 
that a very fine division is obtained. J- ne 
advantage of the dyeing method consists 
in that colorings can be produced with 
slieht quantities of a salt; besides, the 
fine contours of the figures are in no way 
affected by this manner of co ormg, and 
another notab e advantage lies in the 
mass being colored througW, whereby 
Tgreat durability of the color again 
outside actions is assured. 1 hus a peei

coming detached, such as by rubbing off,

Hardening and Toughening Plaster 
of Paris. — I. — Tlaster of Paris at times 
sets too rapidly; therefore the following 
recipe for toughening and delaying dry- 
ing will be useful. To calcined plaster 
of Paris add 4 per cent of its weight of 
powdered marsh mallow root, which will 
keep it from setting for about an hour, 
ami augment its hardness when set, or 
double the quantity of marshmahW 
root powder, and the plaster will become 
very firm, and may be worked 2 or 3 
hours after mixing, and may be carved 
and polished when hard. It is essential 
that these powders, which are of different 
densities and specific gravities, should be 
thoroughly mixed, and the plaster of 
Paris be quite fresh, and it must be 
passed through fine hair sieves to ensure 
its being an impalpable powder. To 
ensure thorough mixing, pass the com- 
bined powders through the hair sieve 
three times. Make up with water suffi- 
cient for the required model or models. 
Should any of the powder be left over it 
may be kept by being put in an wr-tqjM 
box and placed" in a warm room. 

The marshmallow root powder ma> 
be replaced by dextrin, gum a rab M 
glue. The material treated is nnfrWJ 
while yet in a soft state, for rolling, gi» s 
tube developing, making plates, etc.

?vcr difficult to insure the production of 
ulif'orm tint, it is better when employing 
salts producing color, to mix the plaster 
with about 5 per cent of quicklime, or 
better to render it plastic with milk of 
lime, 'and then to soak the object m a 
solution of metallic sulphate. 

Preservation of Plaster Casts.— Upon 
complete drying, small objects are laid 
for a short while in celluloid varnish of 4 
per cent, while large articles are painted 
with it, from the top downward, using a 
soft brush. Articles set up outside and 
exposed to the weather are not protected 
by this treatment, while others can be 
readily washed off and cleaned with 
water! To cover 100 square feet of 
surface, If pints of celluloid varnish are 
required. 

To Arrest the Setting of Plaster of 
Paris. — Citric acid will delay the setting 
of plaster of Paris for several hours. One 
ounce of acid, at a cost of about 5 cents, 
will be sufficient to delay the setting of 
100 pounds of plaster of Paris for % or 3 
hours. Dissolve the acid in the water 
before mixing the plaster. 

Weatherproofing Casts. — I. — Bre- 

thauer's method of preparing plaster of 
Paris casts for resisting the action of the 
weather is as follows: Slake 1 part of 
finely pulverized lime to a paste, then mix 
gypsum with hmewater and intimately 
mix both. Prom the compound thus 
prepared the figures are cast. When 
perfectly dry they are painted with hot 
hnseed oil, repeating the operation sev- 
eral times, then with linseed-oil varnish, 
and finally with white oil paint. Stat- 
ues, etc., prepared in this way have been 
constantly exposed to the action of the 
"weather for 4 years without suffering any 
change, 

II- — Jacobsen prepares casts which 
detain no dust, and can be washed with 



lukewarm soap water by immersing 
them or throwing upon them in a fine 
spray a hot solution of a soap prepared 
from stearic acid and soda lye in ten 
times its quantity, by weight, of hot 
water. 

Reproduction of Plaster Originals. — 

This new process consists in making a 
plaster mold over the original in the 
usual manner. After the solidification 
of the plaster the mass of the original is 
removed, as usual, by cutting out and 
rinsing out. The casting mold thus 
obtained is next filled out with a ceramic 
mass consisting of gypsum, 1 part; pow- 
dered porcelain, 5 parts; and flux, 1 part. 
After the mass has hardened it is baked 
in the mold. This renders the latter 
brittle and it falls apart on moistening 
with water while the infusion remains as 
a firm body, which presents all the de- 
tails of the original in a true manner.

Antique Bronzes. — In order to give 
new bronze castings the appearance and 
patina of old bronze, various composi- 
tions are employed, of which the follow- 
ing are the principal ones: 

I. — Vert Antique: Vinegar, 1,000

platinum and water, will form a ehoco 
fate brown of considerable depth of tone 
and is exceedingly applicable to brass 
surfaces which are to resemble a copp et 
bronze. 

Copper Bronzing. — I . — After cleaning 
the pieces, a mixture made as follows ia 
passed over them with a brush: Castor 
oil, 20 parts; alcohol, 80 parts; soft 
soap, 40 parts; water, 40 parts. The day 
after application, the piece has become 
bronzed; and if the time is prolonged, 
the tint will change. Thus, an affinity 
of shades agreeable to the eye can be 
procured. The piece is dried in hot saw- 
dust, and colorless varnish with large ad- 
dition of alcohol is passed over it. This 
formula for bronzing galvanic apparatus 
imparts any shade desired, from Bar- 
bodienne bronze to antique green, pro- 
vided the liquid remains for some time 
in contact with the copper. 

II. — Acetate of copper, 6 parts; sal 
ammoniac, 7 parts; acetic acid, 1 part; 
distilled water, 100 parts. Dissolve a I 
in water in an earthen or porcelain vessel. 
Place on the fire and heat slightly; warn 
with a brush give the objects to M 
bronzed 2 or 3 coats, according to tne 
shade desired. It is necessary that eacn 
coat be thoroughly dry before appW 
another.

^ eP a 1fv "Bowing the suspended matter to 
and decanting the clear liquid. 
T he obTect of this is, of course, to neu- 
any acid which may be present. 
To determine how effectively this has 
been clone, the varnish may be chem- 
ically tested. 

t ~ TirnnzinE. — I. — The surface ot a 
JiS B p3j cleaned and polished 
f s evelly painted with a vegetable oil, 
i T o We oil, and then well heated, care 
befnff taken that the temperature docs 
not nse to a point at winch the oil will 
h„rn The cast iron absorbs oxygen at 
the moment when the decomposition of 
the oil begins, and a brown layer of oxide 
[ formed which adheres firmly to the 
surface and which may be vigorously 
polished, giving a bronze-like appearance 
to the surface of the iron. 

jl To give polished iron the ap- 
pearance of bronze commence by clean- 
W the objects, then subject them for 
about 5 minutes to the vapor of a mix- 
ture of concentrated hydrochloric and 
nitric acids; then smear them with vase- 
line and heat them until the vaseline be- 
gins to decompose. The result is a, fine 
bronzing. 

Liquid for Bronze Powder.— Take 2 
ounces gum animi and dissolve in 1 pint 
linseed oil by adding gradually while the 
oil is being heated. Boil, strain, and 
dilute with turpentine. 

Bronzing Metals. — I. — The following 
composition is recommended for bronz- 
ing metal objects exposed to the air: 
Mix about equal parts of siccative, recti- 
fied oil of turpentine, caoutchouc oil, and 
dammar varnish, and apply this com- 
position on the objects, using a brush. 
This bronze has been found to resist the 
influences of the weather. 

II. — Cover the objects with a light layer 
of linseed oil, and then heat over a coal 
fire, prolonging the heat until the de- 
sired shade is reached. 

III. — Expose the objects to be bronzed 
for about 5 minutes to the vapors of a 
bath composed of 50 parts of nitric acid 
and 50 parts of concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid. Then rub the articles with 
vaseline and heat until the vaseline is 
decomposed. The objects to be bronzed 
must always be perfectly polished. 

IV. — To bronze iron articles they 
Bhould be laid in highly heated coal dust; 
the articles must be covered up in the 
glowing dust, and the heat must be the 
same throughout. The iron turns at 



first yellow, then blue, and finally rather 
black. Withdraw the objects when they 
have attained the blue shade or the black 
color; then while they are still hot, rub 
them with a wad charged with tallow. 

V. — For electrolytic bronzing of 
metals the baths employed differ from 
the brass baths only in that they contain 
tin in solution instead of zinc. Accord- 
ing to Eisner, dissolve 70 parts, by 
weight, of cupric sulphate in 1,000 parts 
of water and add a solution of 8 parts of 
stannic chloride in caustic lye. For a 
positive pole plate put in a bronze plate. 
The bath works at ordinary tempera- 
ture. 

VI. — A good bath consists of 10 parts 
of potash, % parts of cupric chloride, 1 
part of tin salt, 1 part of cyanide of potas- 
sium dissolved in 100 parts of water. 

VII. — Mix a solution of 3& parts of 
copper sulphate in 500 parts of water 
with 64 parts of cyanide of potassium. 
After the solution has become clear, add 
4 to 5 parts of stannic chloride dissolved 
in potash lye.

COLORING OF METALS: 

Direct Coloration of Iron and Steel by 
rnnriTselenite.— Iron precipitates cop- 
Ser P and selenium from their salt, Im- 
mersed in a solution of cupnc selenite, 
m dulated with a few drops o nitric acid, 
precipitates these two metals on its sur- 
faced the form of a dull black deposit 
but slightly adherent. But, if the object 
is washed with water, then with alcohol, 
and rapidly dried over a gas burner, the 
deposit becomes adherent. It rubbed 
with a cloth, this deposit turns a blue 
black or a brilliant black, according to 
the composition of the bath. 

The selenite of copper is a greenish 
salt insoluble in water, and but slightly 
soluble in water acidulated with nitric or 
sulphuric acid. It is preferable to mix a 
solution of cupric sulphate with a solu- 
tion of selenions acid, and to acidulate 
with nitric acid, in order to prevent the 
precipitation of the selenite of copper. 

This^ process, originated by Paul Mal- 
herbe, is quite convenient for blackening 
or bluing small objects of iron or steel, 
such as metallic pens or other small 
pieces. It does not succeed so well for 
objects of cast iron; and the selenious 
acid is costly, which is an obstacle to its 
employment on large metallic surfaces. 

The baths are quickly impoverished, 
tor insoluble yellow selenite of iron is 
deposited.

Production of Rainbow Colors 
Metals (iron, copper, brass, zinc, etc V 
I. — The following process of irisation 
is due to Puscher. It allows of covering 
the metals with a thick layer of metallic 
sulphide, similar to that met with in na- 
ture — in galena, for example. 

These compounds arc quite solid and 
are not attacked by concentrated acids 
and alkalies, while dilute reagents are 
without action. In 5 minutes thousands 
of objects of brass can be colored with 
the brightest hues. If they have been 
previously cleaned chemically, the colors 
deposited on the surface adhere with such 
strength that they can be worked with 
the, burnisher. 

Forty-five parts of sodium hyposulphite 
are dissolved in 500 parts of water; a 
solution of 15 parts of neutral acetate of 
lead in 500 parts of water is poured in. 
The clear mixture, which is composed of 
a double salt of hyposulphite of lead and 
of sodium, possesses, when heated to $W 
P., the property of decomposing si Wl y 
and of depositing brown hakes oi lead 
sulphide. If an article of gold, silver, 
copper, brass, tombac, iron, or zinc J 
put into this bath while thc precipitation 
is taking place, the object will be covereu 
with a film of lead sulphide, which W« 
give varied and brilliant colors, accoranj 
to its thickness. For a uniform coK»| 
tion, it is necessary that the pieces 
be heated quite uniformly. H y fc qJJ ^

nrecipitates in it a quantity of flakes of 
SSsh brown (cupric sulphide), but if 
Rout one-third of the preceding so- 
i *■ « nf lead acetate is added, a solid 
color S developed, which, when 
with a light coatinj of wax, 
S much in intensity an L solidity, 
ft is also useful to apply a slight coating 
of wax to the other colors. 

ir —Ueautif ul designs may be ob- 
tained, imitating, marble with sheets of 
^nner plunged into a solution of lead, 
tokened by the addition of gum traga- 
ca th and Seated to 212° F. After- 
wards they are treated with the ordinary 
lead solution. The compounds of an- 
timony, for example the tartrate of anti- 
mony and potash, afford similar co ora- 
tions but require a longer time for their 
development. The solutions mentioned 
do not change, even after a long period, 
and may be employed several times. 

HI By mixing a solution of cupric 

sulphate with a solution of sodium hypo- 
sulphite, a double hyposulphite of sodi- 
um and of copper is obtained. 

If in the solution of this double salt an 
article of nickel or of copper, cleaned 
with nitric acid, then with soda, is im- 
mersed, the following colors will appear 
in a few seconds: Brilliant red, green, 
rose, blue, and violet. To isolate a color, 
it is sufficient to take out the object and 
wash it with water. The colors obtained 
on nickel present a moire appearance, 
similar to that, of silk fabrics. 

IV. — Tin sulphate affords with so- 
dium hyposulphite a double salt, which 
is reduced by heat, with production of tin 
sulphide. The action of this double 
salt on metallic surfaces is the same as 
that of the double salts of copper and 
lead. Mixed with a solution of cupric 
sulphate, all the colors of the spectrum 
will be readily obtained. 

V. — Coloration of Silver. — The ob- 
jects of copper or brass are first covered 
with a layer of silver, when they are 
dipped in the following solution at the 
temperature of 205° to 212° F.: Water, 
3,000 parts; sodium hyposulphite, 300 
parts; lead acetate, 100 parts. 
, VI. — Iron precipitates bismuth from 
its chlorhydne solution. On heating 
this deposit, the colors of the rainbow 
are obtained. 

Coloration by Electrolysis. — I. — Col- 
ored Rings by Electrolysis (Nobili, Bec- 
querel). — In order to obtain the Nobili 
rings it is necessary to concentrate the 
current coming from one of the poles of 
the battery through a platinum wire, 



whose point alone is immersed in the 
liquid to be decomposed, while the other 
pole is connected with a plate of metal 
in the same liquid. This plate is placed 
perpendicularly to the direction of the 
wire, and at about 0.04 inches from the 
point. 

Solutions of sulphate of copper, sul- 
phate of zinc, sulphate of manganese, ace- 
tate of lead, acetate of copper, acetate 
of potassium, tartrate of antimony and 
potash, phosphoric acid, oxalic acid, 
carbonate of soda, chloride of manga- 
nese, and manganous acetate, may be em- 
ployed. 

II. — A process, due to M. O. Mathey, 
allows of coloring metals by precipitating 
on their surface a transparent metallic 
peroxide. The phenomenon of electro- 
chemical coloration on metals is the 
same as that which takes place when an 
object of polished steel is exposed to 
heat. It first assumes a yellow color, 
from a very thin coating of ferric oxide 
formed on its surface. By continuing 
the heating, this coating of oxide in- 
creases in thickness, and appears red, 
then violet, then blue. Here, the color- 
ation is due to the increase in the thick- 
ness of a thin coating of a metallic oxide 
precipitated by an alkaline solution. . 

The oxides of lead, tin, zinc, chromium, 
aluminum, molybdenum, tungsten, etc., 
dissolved in potash, may be employed; 
also protoxide of iron, zinc, cadmium, 
cobalt, dissolved in ammonia. 

Lead Solution.—Potash, 400 paTts; 
litharge or massicot, 125 parts. Boil 10 
minutes, filter, dilute until the solution 
marks 25° Be. 

Iron Solution— Dissolve ferrous sul- 
phate in boiling, water and preserve 
sheltered from air. . When desired for 
use pour a quantity into a vessel and add 
ammonia until the precipitate is redis- 
solved This solution, oxidizing rapidly 
in the air, cannot be used for more than 
an hour.

ft —The brass is immersed in a dilute 
lolntion of mercurous nitrate; the^aye 
of mercury formed on the brass is con 
verSd into black sulphide if washed 
several times in potassium sulphide. By 
Substituting for the potassium sulphide 
the sulphide of antimony or that or ar- 
senic, beautiful bronze colors are ob- 
tained, varying from light brown to dark 
brown. 

Ill— Clean the brass perfectly. Af- 
terwards rub with sal ammoniac dissolved 
in vinegar. Strong vinegar, 1,000 parts; 
sal ammoniac, 30 parts; alum, 15 parts; 
arsenious anhydride, 8 parts. 

IV. — A solution of chloride of plati- 
num is employed, which leaves a very 
light coating of platinum on the metal, 
and the surface is bronzed. A steel tint 
or gray color is obtained, of which the 
shade depends on the mer,al. If this is 
burnished, it takes a blue or steel gray 
shade, which varies with the duration of 
the chemical action, the concentration, 
and the temperature of the bath. A 
dilute solution of platinum is prepared 
thus: Chloride of platinum, 1 part; water, 
5,000 parts. 

Another solution, more concentrated

V. — To give to brass a dull black 
color, as that used for optical instruct J 
the metal is cleaned carefully at fu s -' 
and covered with a very dilute mi xtu ' 
of neutral nitrate of tin, 1 part; chloride 
of sold, 2 parts. At the end of iq jqC 
uteS this covering is removed with a 
moist brush. If an excess of acid ha, 
not been employed, the surface of 
metal will be found to be of a fine dull 
black. , . 

The nitrate of tin is prepared by d e . 
composing the chloride of this metal 
with ammonia and afterwards dissolving 
in nitric acid the oxide of tin formed. 

VI. — For obtaining a deposit of his. 
muth the brass is immersed in a boiling 
bath, prepared by adding 50 to GO parts of 
bismuth to nitric acid diluted with 1,000 
parts of water, and containing 3a parts 
of tartaric acid. 

VII. — The electrolysis of a cold solu- 
tion of 25 to 30 parts per 1,000 parts of 
the double chloride of bismuth and am- 
monium produces on brass or on copper 
a brilliant adherent deposit of bismuth, 
whose appearance resembles that of old 
silver. 

Production of E.ainbow Hues. — Var- 
ious colors. — 1. — Dissolve tartrate of 
antimony and of potash, 30 parts; tar- 
taric acid, 30 parts; water, 1,000 parts. 
Add hydrochloric acid, 90 to 120 parts; 
pulverized antimony, 90 to 120 parts. 
Immerse the object of brass in this boil- 
ing liquid, and it will be covered with a 
film, which, as it thickens, reflects quite a 
series of beautiful tints, first appearing 
iridescent, then the color of gold, copper, 
or violet, and finally of a grayish m *: 
These colors are adherent, and do not 
change in the air.

The article is afterwards washed, and 
dried with a piece of cloth. Beautiful 
red tin s are obtained by placing the 
objects between 2 plates, or better yet, 
3 pieces of iron wire-cloth. 

IY, Put in a flask 100 parts of cupric 

carbonate and 750 parts of ammonia and 
shake. This liquid should be kept in 
weil-stoppered bottles. When it has 
lost its strength, this may be renewed 
by pouring in a little ammonia. The 
objects to be colored should be well 
cleaned. They are suspended in the 
liquid and moved back and forth. After 
a few minutes of immersion, they are 
washed with water and dried in wood 
sawdust. Generally, a deep-blue color 
is obtained. 

V. — Plunge a sheet of perfectly clean 
brass in a dilute solution of neutral 
acetate of copper^ and at the ordinary 
temperature, and in a short time it will 
be found covered with a fine gold yellow. 

VI. — Immerse the brass several times 
in a very dilute solution of cupric chlo- 
ride, and the color will be deadened and 
bronzed a greenish gray. 

A plate of brass heated to302° F. is 
colored violet by rubbing its surface 
gently with cotton soaked with cupric 
chloride, 

YH-— On heating brass, perfectly 
polished, until it can be no longer held

XV. — Metallic moire is obtained by 
mixing two liquids: (a) Cream of tar- 
tar, .5 parts; cupric sulphate, 5 parts; 
water, 250 parts, (b) Water, 125 parts; 
sodium hyposulphite, 15 parts. 

XVI. — A beautiful color is formed 
with one of the following baths: (a) 
Water, 140 parts; ammonia, 5 parts; po- 
tassium sulphide, 1 part. (6) Water : 100 
parts; ammonium sulphydrate, 2 parts. 

Bronzing of Brass. — The object is 
boiled with zinc grains and water satu- 
rated with ammoniacal chlorhydrate. A 
little zinc chloride may be added to 
facilitate the operation, wh'*^ is com- 
pleted as above. 

It may also be terminated by plunging 
the object in the following solution; 
Water, 2,000 parts; vinegar, 100 parts; 
sal ammoniac, 475 parts; pulverized 
verdigris, 500 parts. 
ELECTRO-DEPOSITION PROCESSES. 

The electrodeposition process is tnat 
used in electroplating and dectrotyping. 
It consists in preparing a bath in which 
a metal salt is in solution the articles to 
be plated being suspended so that tney 
hanc in the solution, but are insulated. 
The g bath being provided with an anode 
and cathode for the passing of an elec- 
Sc current, and the article being con- 
nected with the cathode or negative 
poleTthe salts are deposited on its sur- 
face (on the unprotected parts of it. 
surface), and thus receive s . coating or 
plating of the metal in solution.

lutions, copal varnish is generally used; 
but for cold liquids and common work, 
an ordinary varnish, such as engravers 
use for similar purposes, will do very 
well. In the absence of other sub- 
stances, a solution of sealing wax, dis- 
solved in naphtha, may be employed. 

Plating of Aluminum. — The light 
metal may be plated with almost any 
other metal, but copper is most com- 
monly employed. Two formulas for cop- 
pering aluminum follow : 

I. — Make a bath of cupric sulphate, 
30 parts; cream of tartar, 30 parts; soda, 
25 parts; water, 1,000 parts. After well 
scouring the objects to be coppered, im- 
merse in the bath. The coppering may 
also be effected by means of the battery 
with the following mixture: Sodium phos- 
phate, 50 parts; potassium cyanide, 50 
parts; copper cyanide, 50 parts; distilled 
water, 1,000 parts. 

II. — First clean the aluminum in a

to be coppered, with sand or in an acid 
bath, a first coat is deposited in an ordi- 
nary electrolytic bath; then the object is 
placed in a final bath, in which the elec- 
trolyte is projected on the electrode, so 
as to remove all bubbles of gas or other 
impurities tending to attach themselves 
to the surface. The electrolyte employed 
is simply a solution of cupric sulphate in 
very dilute sulphuric acid. For the pre-

but not to obliterate the fine lines or 
features. , 

Coppering Zinc Plate.— The zrac plate 
should first be cleaned with highly di- 
luted hydrochloric acid and the acid 
completely removed with water. Then 
prepare an ammomacal copper solution 
from 3 parts copper sulphate, 3 parts 
spirits of sal ammoniac, and 50 parts 
water If possible the zinc articles are 
dipped into this solution or else the sur- 
face is coated a few times quickly and 
uniformly with a flat, soft brush, leaving 
to dry between the coats. When suffi- 
cient copper has precipitated on the zinc, 
brush off the object superficially. 

Cobaltizing of Metals. — Following are 
various processes for cobaltizing on cop- 
per or other metals previously coppered: 
— Cobalt, 50 parts, by weight; sal am- 
moniac, 25 parts; liquid ammonia, 15 
parts; distilled water, 1,000 parts. < Dis- 
solve the cobalt and the sal ammoniac m 
the distilled water, and add the liquid 
ammonia. 

II. — Pure potash in alcohol, 50 parts, 
by weight; cobalt chloride, 10 parts; 
distilled water, 1,000 parts. Dissolve 
the cobalt in half the distilled water and 
the potash in the other half and unite the 
two. 

III. — Potassium sulphocyanide, 13 
parts, by weight; cobalt chloride, 10 
parts; pure potash in alcohol, 2 parts; 
distilled water, 1,000 parts. Proceed as 
described above. All these baths are 
used hot and require a strong current. 

Tfickel Plating with the Battery. — The 
nickel bath is prepared according to the 
following formula: 

I. — Nickel and ammo- 
nium sulphate.. . 10 parts 

Boracic aeid 4 parts 

Distilled water .... 175 parts 
A sheet of nickel is used as an 



Perfect cleanliness of the surface to be 
coated is essential to success. With 
nickel especially is this the case, as traces 
of oxide will cause it to show dark 
streaks. Finger marks will in any case 
render the deposit liable to peel off. 

Cleansing is generally accomplished 
either by boiling in strong solution of 
potassium hydrate, or, when possible, 
by heating to redness in a blow-pipe 
flame to burn off any adhesive grease, and 
then soaking in a pickle of dilute sul- 
phuric acid to remove any oxide formed 
during the heating. In either case it is 
necessary to subject the article to a 
process of scratch brushing afterwards; 
that is, long-continued friction with wire 
brushes under water, which not only 
removes any still adhering oxide, but 
renders the surface bright 

To certain metals, as iron, nickel, and 
zinc, metallic deposits do not readily 
adhere. This difficulty is overcome by- 
first coating them with copper in a bath 
composed as follows: 
II. — Potassium cyanide. 2 parts 
Copper acetate, in 

crystals - . 2 parts 

Sodium carbonate, 

in crystals 2 parts 

Sodium' bisulphite . . 2 parts 

Water 100 parts 

Moisten the copper acetate with 
small quantity of water and add the so 
dium carbonate dissolved m 20 parts o

Consequently, it is the pructice to re--

the newly deposited metal would peel 
ff the underlying silver. 

Silver Plating.-The term silver de- 
posit designates a coating of silver which 
£ deposited upon glass porcelain, china, 
or other substances. This deposit may 
be made to take the form of any desired 
design, and to the observer it has the ap- 
pearance (in the case of glass) of having 
been melted on. 

Practically all of the plated articles 
are made by painting the design upon 
the glass or other surface by means of a 
mixture of powdered silver, a flux and a 
liquid to make the mixture in the form 
of a paint so that it may be readily spread 
over the surface. This design is then 
fired in a muffle until the flux melts and 
causes the silver to become firmly 
attached to the glass. A thin silver 
deposit is thus produced, which, is a con- 
ductor of electricity, and upon which any 
thickness of silver deposit may be pro- 
duced by electroplating in the usual cya- 
nide silver-plating bath. 

To be successful in securing a lasting 
deposit a suitable flux must be used! 
lhis flux must melt at a lower tempera- 
ture than the glass upon which it is put, 
m order to prevent the softening of the 
articles by the necessary heat and the 
accompanying distortion. Second, a 
suitable muffle must be had for firing the 
glass art.c es upon which the design has 
been pamted Not only must a muffle

To make it, proceed as follows: 



solve i pound of acetate of lead (sugar . 
lead) in 1 quart of water and heat? 
boiling. Dissolve \ pound of borax i 
1 quart of hot water and add to the sutrn 
of lead solution. Borate oF lead folloV 
as a white precipitate This is fil ter J 
out and washed until free from imrjuri 
ties. It is then dried. 

The precipitated borate of lead is th er , 
melted in a porcelain or clay crumble 
When in the melted condition it should 
be poured into a basin of cold water 
This serves to granulate and render it 
easily pulverized. After it has been 
poured into water it is removed and 
dried. Before using in the paint it i s 
necessary that this fused borate of lead 
be ground in a mortar as fine as possible. 
Unless this is doue the deposit will not be 
smooth. 

The silveT to be used should be finely 
powdered silver, which can be purchased 
m the same manner as bronze powders, 
The mixture used for painting the de- 
sign upon the glass is composed of 2 
parts of the powdered silver, and 1 part 
of the fused borate of lead. Place the 
parts in a mortar and add just enough 
oil of lavender to make the mass of a 
paint-like consistency. The whole is 
then ground with the pestle until it is as 
fine as possible. The amount of oil of 
lavender which is used must not be too 
great, as it will then be found that a 
thick layer cannot be obtained upon the 
glass. , 

The glass to be treated must be 
cleaned "by scouring with wet ptnntJS 
stone and washing soda. The glass 
should be rinsed and dried. The design 
is then painted on the glass with a brusn, 
painting as thick as possible aIld r ij ie

Steel Plating.— The following is a 
solution for dipping steel articles before 
kct opiating: titrate of silver 1 part; 
nitrate of mercury, 1 part; nitric acid 
(specific gravity, 1.384) 4 parts; water, 
g& parts. The .article, .free from 
grease, is dipped m the pickle for a 
second or two. , . • 

The following electroplating bath is 
used 1 Pure crystallized ferrous sulphate, 
40 parts, by weight, and ammonium 
chloride, 100 parts, by weight, in 1,000 
oarts by weight, of water. It is of ad- 
?antage y to fdd to this 100 .parts, by 
weight, of ammonium citrate, m order lo 
prevent the precipitation of basic iron 
salts, especially at the anode. 

Tin Plating by Electric Bath.— Most 
solutions give a dead-white film of tin, 
and this has to be brightened by friction 
of some sort, either by scratch brushing, 
burnishing, polishing, or rubbing with 
whiting. The bright tin plates are made 
bright by rolling with polished steel 
rollers. Small articles may be. bright- 
tinned by immersion in melted tin,. alter 
their surfaces have been made chemically 
clean and bright, all of which processes 
entail much time and labor. Benzoic 
acid, boric acid, or gelatin may be tried 
with a -well-regulated current and the 
solution in good working order, but all 
will depend upon the exact working, of 
the solution, the same conditions being 
set up as are present in the deposition or 
other metals. These substances may be 
separately tried, in the proportion of 1 
ounce to each gallon of the tin solution, 
by boiling the latter and adding either 
one during the boiling, as they dissolve 
much easier with the tin salts than in 
water separately. Tin articles are usu- 
ally brightened and polished with Vienna 
lime or whiting, the first being used with 
linen rags and the latter with chamois 
leather. Tin baths must be used hot, not 
below 75° F., with a suitable current ac- 
cording to their composition. Too strong 



a current produces a bad color, and the 
deposit does not adhere well. A current 
of from 2 to 6 volts will be sufficient. 
Small tinned articles are brightened by 
being shaken in a leather bag containing 
a quantity of bran or by revolving in a 
barrel with the same substance; but large 
objects have to be brightened by other 
means, such as scratch brushing and 
mopping to give an acceptable finish to 
the deposited metal. 



GILDING AND GOLD PLATING: 

Genuine gilding readily takes up mer 
cury, while imitation gilding does not or 
only very slowly. Any coating of var- 
nish present should, however, be re- 
moved before conducting the test. Mer 
curous nitrate has no action on genuin 
gold, but on spurious gilding a whit 
spot will form which quickly turns dar 
A solution of neutral copper chlorid 
docs not act upon genuine gold, but o 
alloys containing copper a black sp 
will result. Gold fringe, etc., retai 
its luster in spirit of wine, if the cildm 
is genuine; if not, the gilding. will bu 
and oxidize. Imitation gilding mig 
be termed "snuff gilding, ' as in Ge 
many it consists of dissolved brass, sn 
saltpeter, hydrochloric acid, etc., and 
used for tin toys. An expert will i 
mediately see the difference, as geum 
gilding has a different, more compa 
pore formation and a better colo 
There are also some gold varnish 
which are just as good. 

The effect of motion while an article is 
(receiving the deposit is most clearly seen 
/ during the operation of gilding. If a 
' watch dial, for instance, be placed in the 
Siding ba h and allowed to remain for a 
few moments undisturbed and the solu- 
tion of gold has been much, worked, it is 
probabfe that the dia will acquire a 
T^rk fox-red color; but if it he quickly 
moved about, it instantly changes cobr

times been found that dry scratch brush-

ders the surface a better and more uni-

more readily receive the deposit. In 
fact, dry scratch brushing is very useful 
in many cases in which it is desirable to 
impart an artificial coating of brass upon 
an article to which silver or gold will not 
readily adhere. In scratch brushing 
without the employment of beer or some 
other liquid, however, great care must 
be taken not to continue the operation 
too long, as the minute partieles of metal 
given off by the scratch brush would be 
likely to prove prejudicial to the health 
of the operator, were he to inhale them 
to any great extent.

gilding m the cold, by plunging into thU 
bath the aluminum articles previously 
pickled by passing through caustic po| 
ash and nitric acid. _ This gilding is qfe 
tained without the aid of the battery. 

II. — The gold bath is prepared with 
gold dissolved in the usual way, and the 
addition of salts, as follows: Gold, 20 
parts, by weight; sulphate of soda, 20 
parts; phosphate of soda, 6G0 parts; 
cyanuret of potassium, 40 parts; water' 
1,000 parts. The bath ought to be of 
the temperature of 68° to 77° F. 

Amalgam Gold Plating.— Gold amal- 
gam is chiefly used as a plating for silver, 
copper, or brass. The article to be 
plated is washed over with diluted nitric 
acid or potash lye and prepared chalk, 
to remove any tarnish or rust that might 
prevent the amalgam from adhering. 
After having been polished perfectly 
bright, the amalgam is applied as evenly 
as possible, usually with a fine scratch 
brush. It is then set upon a grate over 
a charcoal fire, or placed into an oven 
and heated to that degree at which mer- 
cury exhales. The gold, when the mer- 
cury has evaporated, presents a dull 
yellow color. Cover it with a coating ot 
pulverized niter and alum in equal parts, 
mixed to a paste with water, and urn* 
again till it is melted, then plunge mm 
water. Burnish up with a steel 
bloodstone burnisher. 

Brass Gilding.— On brass, whichjsg 
electropositive metal, an electron^ , 
metal, such as gold, can be depog^ 
very cheaply from the dilute so ' 
of its salts. The deposit is nstur ^ 
very thin, but still quite adhesiv^ ^

solution dip linen rags, et them dry in a

tinder, which is rubbed up in a porcelain 
dish Into the powder so made, dip a 
soft' slightly charred cork, moistened 
with a little vinegar, or else use only the 
finger, and rub the gold powder upon 
the brass articles. 

H To Give Brass a Golden Color, 

it is dipped until the desired shade is ob- 
tained into a solution of about 175 X ., 
produced as follows: Boil 4 parts of 
caustic soda, 4 parts of milk sugar, and 
100 parts of water for 15 minutes; next 
add 4 parts of blue vitriol, dissolved m as 
little water as possible'. 

Copper and Brass Gilding.— The solu- 
tions used to gild copper can b gener- 
ally used also for brass articles. Copper 
gilding acquires importance because in 
order to gild iron, steel, tin, and zinc, they 
must first be coated with copper, if the 
boiling method is to be employed. Fol- 
lowing is Langbein's bath for copper and 
brass: 

Dissolve 1 part, by weight, of chloride 
of gold and 16 parts, by weight, of potas- 
sium cyanide in 250 parts, by weighc. or 
water; dissolve also and separately, 5 
parts, by weight, of sodium phosphate 
and 3 parts, by weight, of caustic potash 
in 750 parts, by weight, of cold water. 
Mix these solutions and bring them to a 
boil. If the action subsides, add from 
3 to 5 parts, by weight, more potassium 
cyanide, The polished iron and steel 
objects must first be copper- plated by 
dipping them into a solution of 5 parts, 
by weight, of blue vitriol and 2 parts, by 
weight, of sulphuric acid in 1,000 parts, 
by weight, of water. They may now be 
dipped into a hot solution containing 6 
parts, by weight, of gold chloride and 
22 \ parts, by weight, of soda crystals in 
75 parts, by weight, of water. This 
coating of gold may be polished. 

Cold Chemical Gilding. — The chem- 
ical gilding by the wet process is accom- 
plished by E. E. Stahl with the aid of three 
baths: A gold bath, a neutralization 



bath, and a reduction bath. The gold 
bath is prepared from pure hydrochloric 
acid, 200 parts; nitric acid, 100 parts; 
and pure gold. The gold solution evap- 
orated to crystallization is made to con- 
tain \ \ per cent of gold by diluting with 
water. The neutralization, bath con- 
sists of soda lye of 6°, of pure sodium 
hydroxide, and distilled water. The 
reduction bath contains a mixture of 
equal parts of 90 per cent alcohol and 
distilled water, wherein pure hydrogen 
has been dissolved. The gilding proper 
is conducted by first entering the article 
in the gold bath, next briskly moving i 
about in the neutralization bath, an 
finally adding the_ reducing bath_ wit 
further strong agitation of the liquid 
The residues from the gilding are melte 
with 3 parts each of potash, powdere 
borax, and potash niter, thus recoverin 
the superfluous gold. . The gilding o 
silvering respectively produces a depos" 
of gold or silver of very slight thicknes 
and of the luster of polishing gold. B 
sides the metal solution an"anti-reduce 
is needed, consisting of 50 grams of rec' 
fied and rosinified turpentine oil and 
grams of powdered roll sulphur. Fro 
this is obtained, by boiling, a syrup 
balsam, to which is added, before us 
lavender oil, well-ground basic bismu" 
nitrate, and the solution for gilding 
silvering. The last takes place by 
hydrochloric solution of aluminum wi 
the above balsam. 

Colored Gilding. — A variety of shad 
of green and red gold can be obtain 
by the electro-chemical process win 
method may be employed for the decor 
tion of various objects of art. In order 
produce red gold in the different shad 
a plate of pure copper is hung into a rata 
concentrated gold bath (5 to 6 parts 
weight, per 1,000 parts of liquid), wni 
S Snnerted with the battery in such 
manner that gold is de posited on the a 
tide immersed in the bath. By the acu 
of the electric current copper is drssolv 
as well from the copper plate : and is sep 
rated simultaneously with the gold, 
Sat after a certain time, a deposit co 

afning a gold copper alloy, conforming

Gilding of Glass. — I- — In order to 
produce a good gilding on glass, the gold 
salt employed must be free from acid. 
Prepare three solutions, viz. ; 

a. 20 parts acid-free gold chloride in 
150 parts of distilled water. 

b. 5 parts dry sodium hydrate in 80 
parts of distilled water. 

c. 2 1 parts of starch sugar in SO parts 
distilled water; spirit of wine, 20 parts; 
and commercial pure 40 per cent alde- 
hyde, 20 parts. These liquids are quickly 
mixed together in the proportion of 200, 
50, and 5 parts, whereupon the mixture is 
poured on the glass previously cleaned 
with soda solution, and the gilding will 
be effected in a short time. The gold 
coating is said to keep intact for years.

the solution thoroughly about one-half 
replacing the evaporating water and 
filter after cooling, in case a sediment 
should appear. To this gold bath vetv 
carefully add some silver bath. The 
platinum sheets which are to serve a, s 
anodes are employed 1£ inches long, l 
inch broad, and rJrs of an inch thick 
"With these anodes the gold tone can be 
somewhat regulated by hanging more or 
less deeply into the solution during the 
gilding. The current should have a tension 
of 3 to 4 volts. In the case of batteries 
three Busen elements^ are connected for 
current tension. It is difficult to pro- 
duce old gold on silver, especially if the 
raised portions are to appear green. 
It is most advantageous first to lightly

Eer off again on the high places by

hang at once in the above gold bath, 
If the embossed portions should be too 
mat, brighten slightly by scratching 
with a very fine brass wire brush. In 
this manner a handsome brown shade is 
obtained in the deep places and a green 
color on the raised portions. This proc- 
. ess requires practice. Since this method 
will produce only a very light gilding, a 
coating of white varnish will protect toe 
articles from tarnishing.

very thin, but durable. _ 

tt This is especially suitable tor 

monograms. Take gold bronze and 
pkce as much as can be taken up with 
the point of a knife in a color-cup, 
moistening with a few drops of genuine 
Engl h gold paint. Coat the raised 
portions sparingly with gold, usmg a fine 
pencil; next, coat the outer and inner 
borders of the design. _ When the work 
is done, and if the staining and gilding 
have been unsuccessful, which occurs 
frequently at the outset, lay the work 
for 5 or 10 minutes in warmed lead water 
and brush off with pumice stone. By 
this process very fine shades are often 
obtained which cannot be produced by 
mere staining. Since the gold readily 
wears off on the high places of the work, 
it is well to lightly coat these portions 
with a thin shellac solution before gild- 
ing. This will cause the gilding to be 
more permanent. 

Mat Gilding. — To obtain a handsome 
mat gilding the article, after having 
been neatly polished, is passed through 
a sand-blast, such as is found .in glass- 
grinding and etching establishments; 
next, the object is carefully cleansed 
of fine sand (if possible, by annealing 
and decocting), thereupon it is gilt and 
subsequently brushed mat with the brass 
brush. Where there is no sand-blast, 
the article is deadened with the steel 
wire brush, which will produce a satis- 
factory result, after some practice. After 
that, treatment is as above. The above- 
mentioned applies in general only to 
silver articles. In case of articles at 
gold, brass, or tombac, it is better to 
previously silver them strongly, since 
they are too hard for direct treatment 



with the steel wire brush, and a really 
correct mat cannot be attained. The 
brushes referred to are, of course, cir- 
cular brushes for the lathe. 

Dead-Gilding of an Alloy of Copper 
and Zinc. — The parts which are to be 
deadened must be isolated from those 
which are to be polished, and also from 
those which are to be concealed, and 
which therefore are not to be gilded. 
For this purpose they are coated with a 
paste made of Spanish white mixed with 
water. The articles prepared in this 
manner are then attached by means of 
iron wire to an iron rod and suspended 
in a furnace constructed for this process. 
The floor of this furnace is covered on 
four sides with plates of enameled earth- 
enware for receiving the portions spat- 
tered about of the sail mixture given off 
later 

In the middle is an oven constructe( 
like a cooking stove, on which is an iron 
tripod for carrying the deadening pan; 
this latter is cemented into a second par 
of cast iron, the intervening space beini 
filled up with stove cement. In the mid- 
dle of the pan is the bottom or sill, pro- 
vided with a thick cast-iron plate, form- 
ing the hearth. On all four sides of the 
latter are low brick walls, connecting 
with the floor of the furnace, and the 
whole is covered with thick sheet metal. 
On the side of the furnace opposite in- 
side arranged for carrying the pans, is 
boiler in which boiling water is kept. 
On the same side of the furnace, but out- 
side it is a large oval tub of a capacity of 
about' WO or S 800 quarts, which is kep 
filled with water. The upper P°rt"»* 
of the staves of this tub are covered with 
finen to Ibsorb all parts that are spat- 
tered about.

of sheet iron over a clear coke or char-

water. 

Red Gilding. — This is obtained by the 
use of a mixture of equal parts of verdi- 
gris and powdered tartar, with which the 
article is coated; subsequently burning it 
off on a moderate coal fire. Cool in 
water, dip the article in a pickle of tartar, 
xratch it, and a handsome red shade 
will be the result, which has not attacked 
the gilding in any way. 

kegilding Mat Articles. — In order to 
regenerate dead gold trinkets without 
having to color them again — which is, as 
a rule, impossible, because the gold is too 
weak to stand a second coloring — it is 
advisable to copper these articles over 
before gilding them. After the copper 
has deposited all over, the object, well

The silk thus impregnated is treated in 
the solution of an alkaline sulphide'e » 
sodium sulphide, ammonium sulphij'' 
or else with hydrogen sulphide, thus pro' 
ducing a conductive coating of metallic 
sulphide. Upon this gold can be p re . 
cipitated by electrodeposition in the usual 
way. 

Spot Gilding. — Gilding in. spots, p ro , 
ducing a very fine appearance, is done 
by putting a thin coat of oil on thos" 
parts of the metal where the gilding is not 
to appear; the gold will then be deposited 
in those spots only where there is no oil, 
and the oil is easily removed when the 
work is finished. 

Gilding Steel. — Pure gold is dissolved 
in aqua regia; the solution is allowed to 
evaporate until the acid in excess has 
gone. The precipitate is placed in clean 
water, 3 times the quantity of sulphuric 
acid is added and the whole left to stand 
for 24 hours in a well-closed flask, until 
the ethereal gold solution floats on tcp. 
By moistening polished steel with the 
solution a very handsome gilding is ob- 
tained. By the application of designs 
with any desired varnish the appearance 
of a mixture of gold and steel may be im- 
parted to the article. 

Wood Gilding. — I. — The moldings, 
ledges, etc., to be gilded are painted with 
a strong solution of joiners' glue, which 
is left to harden well, whereupon 18 to LV 
coatings of glue mixed with whitening 
are given. Each coat must, of course, 
be thoroughly dry, before commencing 
the next. After this has been done, 
paint with a strong mixture of glue a 
minium, and while this is still wet, put 
the gold leaflets and press them do* 
with cotton. To impart the line g< ^ 
polish with a burnishing agate art 
superfluous gold has been removed.
