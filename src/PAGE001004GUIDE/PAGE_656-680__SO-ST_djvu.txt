A eas or gasoline blow torch or a char- 
cofl furnfee is best for heating be iron, 
but a good, clean coal fire, well coked, 
•will answer the purpose. 

When in use, the iron should be hot 
enough to melt the so der readily. A 
cold iron produces rough work inis is 
where the beginner usually fails. It pos- 
sible, it is well to warm the pieces 
before applying the iron, I he iron 
must not be heated too hot, however, or 
the tin on the point will be oxidized. 
The surfaces to be soldered must be 
clean. Polish them with sandpaper, 
emery cloth, a file, or a scrapei\ Grease 
or oil will prevent solder from sticking. 

Some good soldering fluid should be 
used. A very good fluid is made by dis- 
solving granulated zinc in muriatic acid. 
Dissolve as much zinc as possible in the 
acid. The gas given off will explode if 
ignited. To granulate the zinc, melt it 
in a ladle, and pour it slowly into a barrel 
of water. A brush or swab should be 
used to spread the fluid on the surfaces 
to be soldered. If the point of the solder- 
ing iron becomes dirty, it should be 
wiped on a cloth or piece of waste that 
has been dampened with the soldering 
fluid. 

Soldering of Metallic Articles. — In a 
recently invented process the parts to be 
united are covered, on the surfaces not 
to be soldered, with a protective mass, 
which prevents an immediate contact of 
the solder with the surfaces in question, 
and must be brushed off only after the 
soldered pieces have cooled perfectly, 
whereby the possibility of a change of 
position of these pieces seems precluded. 

hor the execution of this process the 
objects to be soldered, after the surfaces 
to be united have been provided with a 
water-glass solution as the soldering agent 
and placed together as closely as possible 
or united by wires or rivets, arc coated in 
the places where no solder is desired with 
a protective mass, consisting essentially 



of carbon (graphite, coke, or charcoab 
powdered talc or asbestos, ferric hydra* 
(with or without ferrous hydrate), 
if desired, a little aluminum oxide t^' 
gether with a bin dine agent of the'eu, 
tomary kind (glue solution, beer). 

Following are some examples of ft 
composition of these preparations; 6 

I. — Graphite, 50 parts; powdered coke 
5 parts; powdered charcoal, 5 parts; p 0w ' 
dered talc, 10 parts; glue solution, 2 5 
parts; drop beer, 2.5 parts; ferric hydrate 
10 parts; aluminum oxide, 5 parts. ' 

II. — Graphite, burnt, 4 parts; graphite 
unburnt, 6 parts; powdered charcoal, 3 
parts; powdered asbestos, 1 part; ferric 
hydrate, 3 parts; ferrous hydrate, 2 
parts; glue solution, 1 part. 

The article thus prepared is plunged, 
after the drying of the protective layer 
applied, in the metal bath serving as 
solder (molten brass, copper, etc.), and 
left to remain therein until the part to 
be soldered has become red hot, which 
generally requires about 50 to 60 
seconds, according to the size of the ob- 
ject. In order to avoid, in introducing 
the article into the metal bath, the 
scattering of the molten metal, it is well 
previously to warm the article and to dip 
it warm. After withdrawal from the 
metal bath the soldered articles are al- 
lowed to cool, and are cleaned with wire 
brushes, so as to cause the bright surfaces 
to reappear. 

The process is especially useful for 
uniting iron or steel parts, such as 
machinery, arms, and bicycle parts in a 
durable manner. 

Soldering Acid. — A very satisfactory 
soldering acid may be made by the usee 
the ordinary soldering acid for the base 
and introducing a certain proportion v 
chloride of tin and sal ammoniac, x 
gives an acid which is superior m ew*

be slightly cloudy when the 3 have been

of muriatic acid will render it perfectly

is necessary to do this, as the solution 
would then contain too much of this 
ingredienL and the results would be in- 
jurious. 

This soldering acid will not spatter 
when the iron is applied to it. It has 
also been found that a poorer grade of 
solder may be used with it than with 
the usual soldering acid. 

ALUMINUM SOLDERS. 

To solder aluminum it is necessary 
previously to tin the parts to be soldered. 
This tinning is done with the iron, using 
a composition of aluminum and tin. 
Replace the ordinary soldering iron by 
an iron of pure aluminum. Prepara- 
tion of aluminum solder: Commence by 
fusing the copper; then add the alumi- 
num m several installments, stir the mix- 
ture well with a piece of iron; next add 
«je zinc and a little tallow or benzine at 
tie same time. Once the zinc is added 
not heat too strongly, to avoid the 
volatmzation of the zinc.

BRASS SOLDERS. 

Brass solder consists of brass fusible 
at a low temperature, and is made by 
melting together copper and zinc, the 
latter being in excess. A small quantity 
of tin is often added to render the solder 
more fusible. Hard solders are usualh 
sold in the form of granules. Althougl 
many workers in metals make their owi 
solder, it is advisable to use hard soldei 
made in factories, as complete uni- 
formity of quality is more easily securer 1 
where large quantities are manufacturer* 
In making hard solder the melte< 
metal is poured through birch twigs ii 
order to granulate it. The granules are 
afterwards sorted by passing thei 
through sieves. 

When brass articles are soft-soldere< 
the white color of the solder contrasts 
unpleasantly with the brass. If this - 
obfected to, the soldered part can 
colored yellow in the following mamiei 
Dissolve 10 parts of copper sulphat 
in 35 parts of water; apply the solution t 
the solder, and stir with a clean iroi 
wire. This gives the part the appeal 
ance of copper. To produce the yelloi 
color, paint the part with, a mixture 
consisting of 1 part of a solution of equ* 
parts of zinc and water (1 part each) n

Copper, at 1,742° F. Because an increase 
in zinc causes a change m color, it is 
sometimes advisable to use tin for zinc, 
at least in part, so that the alloy becomes 
more bronze-like in its properties. Ihe 
durability of the solder is riot seriously 
affected, but its fusibility is lowered. It 
more than a certain proportion ot tin be 
added, thin and very fluid solders are 
obtained of grayish-white color, and very 
brittle— indeed, so brittle that the solder- 
ing joints are apt to open if the object is 
beat. Because too great an addition of 
tin is injurious, the utmost caution must 
be exercised. If very refractory melals 
are to be soldered, brass alone can be 
used. In some cases, a solder can be 
produced merely by melting brass and 
adding copper. The following hard 
solders have been practically tested and 
found of value.

FATS FOR SOLDERING. 

I- — Soldering fat or grease is com- 
monly a mixture of rosin and tallow with 
the addition of a small quantity of sal 

ammoniac Ti : - j— J 

the sold 



It is particularly adapted to 
the soldering of tinned ware, because it is 
easily wiped off the surface after the 
Joint is made, whereas if rosin were 
used alone, the scraping away might 
remove some of the tin and spoil the 
object. 

^■~The following is a well-tried 
nf Pe « ■ a sol dering grease: In a pot 
i sufficient size and over a slow fire 
uieit together 500 parts of olive oil and 
2sn Parts of tallow; then stir in slowly 
XP , .? f rosin in powder, and let the 
U0le hod up once. Now let it cool 



down, and add 1S5 parts of saturated 
solution of sal ammoniac, stirring the 
while. When cold, this preparation will 
be ready for use. 

FLUIDS FOR SOLDERING. 

I- — To the ordinary zinc chloride, 
prepared by digesting chips of zinc in 
strong hydrochloric acid to saturation, 
add $ spirits of sal ammoniac and 4 part 
rain water,_ and filter the mixture. This 
soldering liquid is especially adapted to 
the soft soldering of iron and steel, be- 
cause it does not make rust spots. 

To solder zinc, the zinc chloride may 
be used without any spirit sal ammoniac. 

II. — Mix phosphoric acid with strong 
spirits of wine in the following propor- 
tions: 

Phosphoric acid solu- 
tion 1 quart 

Spirits of wine (80 per 

cent) 1| quarts 

More or less of the spirits of wine 
used depending upon the concentratio 
of the phosphoric acid^ solution. Whe 
this soldering liquid is applied to th 
metal to be soldered, the phosphoric aci 
immediately dissolves the oxide. Th 
hot soldering iron vaporizes the spirits o 
wine very quickly and causes the oxid 
released by the phosphoric acid to for 
a {dazed mass with the surplus phosphon 
acid, which mass can be easily removed 

HI. — Dissolve in hydrochloric aci

Soldering fat for iron is composed ot 
50 parts olive oil and 50 parts powdered 
sal ammoniac. Soldering fat for al- 
uminum is made by melting together 
equal parts of, rosin and tallow, half the 
quantity of zinc chloride being added to 
the mixture. 

Soldering paste consists of neutral 
soldering liquid thickened with starch 
paste. This paste must be applied more 
lightly than the soldering liquid. 

Soldering salt is prepared by mixing 
equal parts of neutral zinc chloride, free 
from iron, and powdered sal ammoniac. 
When required for use, 1 part of the salt 
should be dissolved in 3 or 4 parts water. 

Borax is the flux most frequently used 
for hard-soldering; it should be applied 
to the soldering seam either dry or stirred 
to a paste with water. It is advisable 
to use calcined borax, i. e., borax from 
which the water of crystallization has 
been driven out by heat, as it does not 
become so inflated as ordinary borax. 
Borax dissolves the metallic oxides form- 
ing cm the joint. 

Finely powdered cryolite, or a mixture 
of 2 parts powdered cryolite and 1 part 
phosphoric acid, is also used for hard- 
soldering copper and copper alloys. 
t Midler's hard-soldering liquid con- 
sists of equal parts of phosphoric acid 
and alcohol (80 per cent)- 

A mixture of equal parts of cryolite 
and barium chloride is used as a flux in 
Hard- soldering aluminum bronze. 

very good dry-soldering preparation 
consists of two vials, one of which is filled 



with zinc chloride, and the other wi+v 
ammonium chloride. To use, di SSo t 
a little of each salt in water, ap p l v ,? e

soldered and heat the latter urit ;j £ 
begins to give off vapor of ammonium 
then apply the other, and immediate]; 
thereafter the solder, maintaining \d 
heat in the meantime. This answers 
for very soft solder^ For a harder solder 
dissolve the zinc in a very small p 0F 
tion of the ammonium chloride soluti 0CL 
(from 1 to i pint). 

When steel is to be soldered on steel 
or iron on steel, it is necessary to remove 
every trace of oxide of iron between the 
surfaces in contact. Melt in an earthen 
vessel: Borax, 3 parts; colophony, o 
"parts; pulverized glass, 3 parts; steel 
filings, 2 parts; carbonate of potash, I 
part; hard soap, powdered, 1 part. Plow 
the melted mass on a cold plate of sheet 
iron, and after cooling break up the 
pieces and pulverize them. This powder 
is thrown on the surfaces a few minutes 
before the pieces to be soldered are 
brought together. The borax and glass 
contained in the composition dissolve, 
and consequently liquefy all of the im- 
purities, which, if they were shut up 
between the pieces soldered, might form 
scales, at times dangerous, or interfering 
with the resistance of the piece. 

To prepare rosin for soldering bright 
tin, mix ^ h pounds of olive oil, U pounds 
of tallow," and 12 ounces of pulverized 
rosin, and let them boil up. When this 
mixture has become cool, add If pints 
of water saturated with pulverized sal 
ammoniac, stirring constantly

GERMAN-SILVER SOLDERS. 

Because of its peculiar composition 
German-silver solder is related to the 
ordinary hard solders. Just as hard 
solders may be regarded as varieties of 
brass to which zinc has been added, 
German-silver solders may be regarded 
as German silver to which zinc has been 
added. The German-silver solder be- 
comes more easily fused with an increase 
in zinc, and vice versa. If the quantity 
of zinc be increased beyond a certain 
proportion, the resultant solder becomes 
too brittle. German-silver solders are 
characterized by remarkable strength, 
and are therefore used not only in sol- 
dering German silver, but in many cases 
where special strength is required. As 
German silver can be made of the color 
of steel, it is frequently used for solder- 
ing fine steel articles. 

Solder for ordinary German silver can 
De made of 1,000 parts German-silver 
chips, 125 parts sheet-brass chips, 142 
zinc, and 33 parts tin; or, of 8 
German silver and 2 to 3 parts

to experiment first with small quantities 
in order to ascertain how much zinc is to 
be added. The proper proportion of 
German silver to zinc is reached when 
the mixture reveals a brilliancy and 
condition which renders it possible to 
barely pulverize it while hot. A small 
quantity when brought in contact with 
the soldering iron should just fuse.

GOLD SOLDERS: 

Hard Solder for Gold— The hard 
solder or gold solder which the jeweler 
frequently requires for the execution of 
various works, not only serves for solder- 
ing gold ware, but is also often employed 
for soldering fine steel goods, such as 
spectacles, etc. Fine gold is only used 
for soldering articles ot platinum. Th 
stronger the alloy of the gold, the more 
fusible must be the solder. Generally 
the gold solder is a composition of gold, 
silver, and copper. If it is to be very 
easily fusible, a little zinc may be added, 
but, on the other hand, even the copper 
is sometimes left out and a mixture con- 
sisting only of gold and silver (e. g., equal 
parts of both) is used. The shade of th 
solder also requires attention, which 
must be regulated by varying proportions 
of silver and copper, so that it may be a 
nearly as possible the same as that of th 
gold to be soldered.

COp vV?hich of these compositions should 
be employed depends upon the degree 
5f t£f f Jbflity 5 the enamel to be ap- 
plied If it is very difficult of fusion 
£3y the first named can be used; other- 
wise it may happen that during the 
melting on of the enamel the soluenng 
spots Ire so strongly heated that the 
wider itself melts. For ordinary articles, 
as a rule, only readily fusible enamels 
are employed, and consequently 
readily fusible enameling solder 
here be made use of. Soldering with the 
latter is readily accomplished with the 
aid of the soldering pipe. Although the 
more hardly fusible gold solders may 
also be melted by the use of the ordinary 
soldering pipe, the employment of a special 
small blowing apparatus is recommended 
on account of the resulting ease and 
rapidity of the work. 

SOLDERS FOR GLASS. 

I. — Melt tin, and add to the melted 
mass enough copper, with constant stir- 
ring, until the melted metal consists of 
05 per cent of tin and 5 per cent of 
copper. In order to render the mixture 
more or less hard, add J to 1 per cent of 
zinc or lead. 

II. — A compound of tin (95 parts) 
and zinc (5 parts) melts at 392° F., and 
can then be firmly united to glass. An 
alloy of 90 parts of tin and 10 parts_ of 
aluminum melts at 734° F., adheres, like 
the preceding, to glass, and is equally 
brilliant. With either of these alloys 
glass may be soldered as easily as metal, 
in two ways. In one, heat the pieces of 
glass in a furnace and rub a stick of 
soldering alloy oveT their surfaces. The 
alloy will melt, and can be easily spread 
by means of a roll of paper or a slip of 
aluminum. Press the pieces firmly to- 
gether, and keep so until cool. In the 



other method a common soldering i roil 
or a rod of aluminum, is heated over a 
coal fire, a gas jet, or a flarae su Pp li ed 
by petroleum. lhe hot iron is passed 
over the alloy and then over the pieces to 
be soldered, without the use of a dis- 
solvent. Care should be taken that 
neither the soldering irons nor the glass 
be brought to a temperature above the 
melting point of the alloy, lest the latter 
should be oxidized, and prevented from 
adhering. 

HARD SOLDERS. 

Hard solders are distinguished as 
brass, German silver, copper, gold, silver, 
etc., according to the alloys used (see Brass 
Solders, Copper Solders, etc., for other 
hard solders). _ 

The designation 'hard solder" is 
used to distinguish it from the easily 
running and softer solder used by tin- 
smiths, and it applies solely to a com- 
position that will not flow under a red 
heat. For the purposes of the jeweler 
solder may be classified according to its 
composition and purpose, into gold or 
silver solder, which means a solder con- 
sisting of an alloy of gold with silver, 
copper, tin, or zinc-like metal or an 
alloy of silver with copper, tin, or zinc- 
like metal. According to the uses, the 
solder is made hard or soft; thus m gold 
solders there is added a greater amount 
of silver, whereas for silver solders there 
is added more tin or zinc-like metal. 

In the production of solder lor me 
euameler's use, that is for combining 
gold with gold, gold with silver, or gold 
with copper, which must be enameled 
afterwards, it is necessary always to Keep

To Hard-Solder Parts Formerly Sol- 
dered with Tin Solder. — To repair gold 
or silver articles which have been spoiled 
with tin solder proceed as follows : Heat- 
ing the object carefully by means a of 
small spirit lamp, brush the tin off as 
niuch as possible with a chalk brush; 
Place the article in a diluted solution of 
nydrochloric acid for about 8 to 10

Silver solders are used not only for 
soldering silver objects, but also for 
soldering metals of which great resist- 
ance is expected. A distinction must be 
drawn between silver solder consisting 
either of copper and silver alone, and 
silver solder to which tin has been added.

STEEL SOLDERING. 

Dissolve scraps of cast steel in as small 
a quantity as possible of nitric acid, add 
finely pulverized borax and stir vigor- 
ously until a fluid paste is formed, then 
dilute by means of sal ammoniac and 
put in a bottle. When soldering is to 
be done, apply a thin layer of the solu- 
tion to the two parts to be soldered, and 
when these have been carried _ to or- 
dinary redness, and the mass is con- 
sequently plastic, beat lightly on the anvil 
with a flat hammer. This recipe is useful 
for cases when the steel is not to be 
soldered at an elevation of temperature 
to the bright red. 

To Solder a Piece of Hardened Steel. — 
To hard-solder a piece of hardened steel 
such as index (regulator), stop spring (in 
the part which is not elastic), click, etc., 
take a very flat charcoal if the piece is 
difficult to attach; hard-solder and as 
soon as the soldering has been done, 
plunge the piece into oil. All that re- 
mains to be done is to blue it again and 
to polish. 

Soldering Powder for Steel. — Melt in 
an earthen pot 3 parts of borax, 2 of col- 
ophony, i 0 f potassium carbonate, as 
much powdered hard soap, to which 
must be added 3 parts of finely powdered 

SuL and 2 parts of steel flings. The 
melted mass is run out upon a cold plate 

ol;ii j ■ lron ' and when ii; is completely 
]£ u ed it is broken into small bits or 
a'^'y .Powdered. To solder, it is neces- 
facL ? s P rmkle &e powder on the sur-

ng sol ution for steel that will not rust 



or blacken the work is made of 6 ounces 
alcohol, 2 ounces glycerine, and 1 ounce 
oxide of zinc. 

PLATINUM SOLDERS. 

There are many platinum solders in 
existence, but the main principle to be 
borne in mind in jewelry work is that 
the soldering seam should be as little 
perceptible as possible; the solder, there- 
fore, should have the same color as the 
alloy. 

I. — A platinum solder which meets 
these requirements very satisfactorily is 
composed of 9 parts gold and 1 part 
palladium; or, 8 parts gold and 2 parts 
palladium. 

II. — The following is a readily fusible 
platinum solder; Fine silver, 1.555 parts, 
and pure platinum, 0.583 parts. This 
melts easily in the ordinary draught fur- 
nace, as well as before the soldering pipe 
on a piece of charcoal. Of similar 
action is a solder of the following com- 
position, which is very useful for places 
not exposed to the view: 

III. — Fine gold, 1.555 parts; fine sil- 
ver, 0.65 parts; and pure copper, 0.324

the sulphate by means ot zinc, andmix 
it with concentrated sulphuric acid. 
According to the degree of hardness re- 
quired, take from 20 to SO or 36 parts of 
copper. Add, while constantly shaking, 
70 parts of quicksilver, and when the 
amalgam is complete, wash with warm 
water to remove the acid; then allow it 
to cool. In 10 or \% hours tbe composi- 
tion will be hard enough to scratch tin. 
For use, warm it until it reaches the 
consistency of wax, and spread it where 
needed. When cold it will adhere with 
great tenacity. 

Soldering a Ring Containing a Jewel. 
— I. — Fill a small crucible with wet sand 
and bury the part with the jewel in the 
sand. Now solder with soft gold solder, 
holding the crucible in the hand. The 
stone will remain uninjured. 

II. — Take tissue paper, tear it into 
strips about 3 inches in width, and make 
them into ropes; wet them thoroughly 
and wrap the stone in them, passing 
around the stone and through the ring 
until the center of the latter is slightly 
more than half filled with paper, closely 
wound around. Now fix on charcoal, 
permitting the stone to protrude over the 
edge of the charcoal, and solder rapidly. 
The paper will not only protect, the stone, 
but also prevent oxidation of the portion 
of the ring which is covered. 

. Soldering without Heat. — For solder- 
ing objects without heating, take a large 
copper wire filed to a point; dip into 
soldering water and rub the parts to be 
aoldered. Then heat the copper wire 



and apply, the solder which melts ot » 
contact. It may then be applied to th e 
desired spot without heating the object 

COLD SOLDERING : 

See also Adhesives and Cements. 
For soldering articles which cannot 
stand a high temperature, the following 
process may be employed; 

I. — Take powdered copper precipi- 
tated from a solution of sulphate by 
means of zinc and mix it in a cast-iron 
or porcelain mortar with concentrated 
sulphuric acid. The number of parts of 
copper varies according to the degree of 
hardness which it is wished to obtain. 
Next add, stirring constantly, 70 parts of 
mercury, and when the amalgam is 
finished, allow to cool. At the end of 10 
to 13 hours the composition is sufficiently 
hard. For use, heat until it acquires the 
consistency of wax. Apply to the sur- 
face. When cool it will adhere with great 
tenacity. 

II. — Crush and mix 6 parts of sulphur, 
6 parts of white lead, and 1 part of 
borax. Make a rather thick cement of 
this powder by triturating it with sul- 
phuric acid. The paste is spread on the 
surfaces to be welded, and the articles 
pressed firmly together. In 6 or 7 days 
the soldering is so strong that the two 
pieces cannot be separated, even by 
striking them with a hammer. 

Cast-iron Soldering. — A new process 
consists in decarbonizing the surfaces ot 
the cast iron to be soldered, the mo ten 
hard solder being at the same time 
brought into contact with the red-hot 
metallic surfaces. The admissioi of * 
however, should be carefully gunrae 
against. First pickle the surfaces d 
pieces to be soldered, as usual, ^ ^ 
and fasten the two pieces togetner.

SOLDERING PASTE. 

The semi-liquid mass termed solder- 
ing paste is produced by mixing zinc 
chloride solution or that of ammonia- 
ziae chloride with starch paste. _ For 
preparing this composition, ordinary 
potato starch is made with water into a 
milky liquid, the latter is heated to a boil 
with constant stirring, and enough of this 
mass, which becomes gelatinous after 
cooling, is added to the 'above-men- 
tioned solutions as to cause a liquid 
resembling thin syrup to result. The 
use of all zinc preparations for soldering 
presents the drawback that vapors of a 
strongly acid odor are generated by the 
heat of the soldering iron, but this evil is 
offset by the extraordinary convenience 
afforded when working with these prepar- 
ations. It is not necessary to subject 
the places to be soldered to any special 
cleaning or preparation. All that is re- 
quired is to coat them with the soldering 
medium, to apply the solder to the seam, 
«c., and to wipe the places with a sponge

SOOT REMOVERS. 

To clean out stovepipes and furnace 
flues of an accumulation of soot without 
trouble or muss, is entirely possible by 
the use of common materials. Metallic 
zinc is one of these soot-removing agents, 
and it can he used in any form, such as 
old tops from fruit jars, old washboard 
coverings, dry-cell cases, and the like. In 
the case of the last-named, a particularly 
pleasing effect is obtained when an old 
dry cell is dropped into the flames of an 
open fire, which produces a delightful 
play of colored light. A handful or two 
of salt thrown into the furnace is also 
good for removing accumulations of soot.

INDUSTRIAL AND POTABLE ALCO-

Abstract of a Farmer^ Bulletin prepared 
for the United States Department of Agricul- 
ture by Dr. Harvey W. Wiley. 

The term "industrial alcohol," or 
spirit, is used for brevity, and also be- 
cause it differentiates sharply between 
alcohol used for beverages or for medi- 
cine and alcohol used for technical pur- 

as here used and as generally - used 
means that particular product which is 
obtained by the fermentation of a sugar, 
or a starch converted into sugar and 
which from a chemical point ot view, 
fa compound of the hypothetical sub- 
stance "ethyl" with water or with that 
oart of water remaining after the sepa 
ration of one of the atoms of hydrogen 
35? is a rather technical expression, but 
5 is very difficult, without using technical 
Kn LIS to give a definition of akohol 
from the chemical point of view. There 
are three elementary substances repre- 
sented in alcohol: Carbon, the chemical 
ynSl of which is C; hydrogen, symbol

fegard to the character of beverages the 
ethyl alcohol is the component of least 
consequence. 

Sources of Potable Alcohol. — The 
raw materials from which alcohol is 
made consist of those crops which con- 
tain sugar, starch, gum and cellulose 
(woody fiber) capable of being easily 
converted into a fermentable sugar. 
Alcohol as such is not used as a beverage. 
The alcohol occurring in distilled bever- 
ages is principally derived from Indian 
corn, rye, barley, and molasses. Alcohol 
is also produced for drinking purposes 
from fermented fruit juices such as the 
juice of grapes, apples, peaches, etc. In 
the production of alcoholic beverages a 
careful selection of the materials is re- 
quired in order that the desired character 
of drink may be secured. For instance, 
in the production of rum, the molasses 
derived from the manufacture of sugar 
from sugar cane is the principal raw 
material. In the fermentation of mo- 
lasses a particular product is formed 
which by distillation gives the alcohol 
coinpuund possessing the aroma and 
flavor of rum. In the making of brandy, 
only sound wine can be used as the raw 
material, and this sound wine, when sub- 
jected to distillation, gives a product con- 
taining the same kind of alcohol as that 
found in rum, but associated with the 
products of fermentation which give to 
the distillate a character entirely dis- 
tinct and separate from that of rum. 
Again, when barley malt or a mixture of 
barley malt and rye is properly mashed, 
fermented, and subjected to distilla- 
tion, a product is obtained which, when 
properly concentrated and aged, becomes 
potable malt or rye whisky. In a sim- 
lla* manner, if Indian corn and bar- 



ley malt are properly mashed, a 
small portion of rye, the mash fermented 
and subjected to distillation, and the 
distillate properly prepared and aged 
the product is known as Bourbon whisky' 
Thus, every kind of alcoholic beverage 
gets its real character, taste, and aroma, 
not from the alcohol which it contains 
but from the products of fermentation 
which are obtained at the same time the 
alcohol is made and which are carried 
over with the alcohol at the time of dis- 
tillation. 

Agricultural Sources of Industrial 
Alcohol. — The chief alcohol-yielding ma- 
terial produced in farm crops is starch, 
the second important material is sugar, 
and the third and least important raw 
material is cellulose, or woody fiber. 
The quantity of alcohol produced from 
cellulose is so small as to be of no im- 
portance at the present time, and there- 
fore this source of alcohol will only be 
discussed under the headings "Utiliza- 
tion of Waste Material or By-Products" 
and "Wood Pulp and Sawdust." 

Starch -Producing Plants.— Starch is a 
compound which, from the chemical 
point of view, belongs to the class known 
as carbohydrates, that is, compounds m 
which the element carbon is associated 
by a chemical union with water, btarca 
is therefore a compound made of carbon, 
hydrogen, and oxygen, existing m the 
proportion of 2 atoms of hydrogen to I 
atom of oxygen. Each molecule c , tar ch 
contains at least 6 atoms of carbon 10 
atoms of hydrogen, and 5 atoms o

those iust mentioned. Among these, the 
sorehum must be first mentioned, con- 
taining in the stalk at the time the seed is 
4ust mature and the starch hardened 
from 9 to 15 per cent of sugar. Sorghum 
seed will also yield as much alcohol as 
equal weights of Indian corn. Ihe 
juices of the stalks of Indian corn con- 
tain at the time the grain is hardening 
and for some time thereafter large quan- 
tities of sugar, varying from 8 to 15 per 
cent. 

In the case of the sorghum and the 
Indian-corn stalk a large part of the 
sugar present is not cane sugar or sucrose 
as it is commonly known, but the invert 
sugar derived therefrom. For the pur- 
poses of making alcohol the invert sugar 
is even more suitable than cane sugar. 
Many other plants contain notable 
quantities of sugar, but, with the excep- 
tion of fruits, discussed under the follow- 
ing caption, not in sufficient quantities to 
be able to compete with those just men- 
tioned for making either sugar or alcohol. 

Cane sugar is not directly susceptible 
to fermentation. Chemically considered, 
it has the formula expressed by the 
symbols: C ls H )a Ou. Wh en cane sugar 
having the above composition becomes 
l , m ' er ^d, it is due to a process known as 
hydrolysis, which consists in the molecule

i± ■ Nearly all fruit juices are 
sugar, varying in content from 5 



rich 



to 30 per cent. The sugar in fruits is 
composed of both cane sugar and its 
invert products (dextrose and levulose), 
in some fruits principally the latter. Of 
the common fruits the grape yields the 
largest percentage of sugar. The normal 
grape used for wine making contains 
from 16 to 30 per cent of sugar, the usual 
amount being about 20 per cent. Fruit 
juices are not usually employed in any 
country for making industrial alcohol, 
because of their very much greater value 
for the production of beverages. < 

Composition and Yield of Alcohol- 
Producing Crops. — The weight of alcohol 
that may be produced from a given crop 
is estimated at a little less than one-half 
of the amount of Jermentable substance 
present, it being understood that the 
fermentable substance is expressed in 
terms of sugar. Pasteur was the first to 
point out the fact that when sugar was 
fermented it yielded theoretically a little 
over one-half of its weight of alcohol. It 
must be remembered, however, that in 
the production of alcohol a process of 
hydrolysis is taking place which adds 
a certain quantity of alcohol to the 
products which are formed. For this 
reason 100 parts of sugar yield more than 
100 parts of fermentable products. The 
distribution of the weights produced, as 
theoretically calculated by Pasteur, is as 
follows: 

One hundred parts of sugar yield the 
following quantities of the products of 
fermentation: 

Alcohol 51-10 parts 

Carbonic acid 49.20 parts

^ Manufacture , / MaZf.- 
A very important cereal m connection 
with the manufacture of alcohol is barley 
which is quite universally employed for 
making malt, the malt in its turn being 
Sed for the conversion of the starch of 
other cereals into sugar in their prepara- 
tion for fermentation. 

Malt is made by the sprouting ot 
barley at a low temperature (from oO to 
60° "P.) until the small roots are formed 
and the germ has grown to the length of 
4 an inch or more. The best malts 
are made at a low temperature requiring 
from 10 to 14 days for the growth of the 
barley. The barley is moistened and 
spread upon a floor, usually of cement, 
to the depth of 1 foot or 18 inches. As 
the barley becomes -warm by the process 
of germination, it is turned from time 
to time and the room is kept well ven- 
tilated and cool. It is better at this 
point in the manufacture of malt to keep 
the temperature below 60° F. After the 
sprouting has been continued as above 
noted for the proper length of time, the 
barley is transferred to a drier, where it 
is subjected to a low temperature at first 
and finally to a temperature not to ex- 
ceed 140° or 158° F., until all the water 
is driven off, except % or 3 per cent. 
Great care must be exercised m drying 
the barley not to raise the temperature 
too high, lest the diastase which is formed 
be deprived of its active qualities. The 
malt has a sweetish taste, the principal 
portion of the starch having been con- 
verted into sugar, which is known 
chemically as "maltose." This sugar is, 
ot course, utilized in the fermentation 
ior trie production of alcohol. Malt is 



chiefly valuaDle, however, not becau 
the amount of alcohol that mav be n r o 
duced therefrom, but from the' fact th \ 
hi quantities of about 10 per cent it; 
capable of converting the starch of ft 
whole of the un malted grains, whate Ve ! 
their origin may be, into maltose, tW 
preparing the starch for fermentation 
Barley is not itself used m this country 
as a source of industrial alcohol, but it L 
employed for producing the highesl 
grades of whisky, made of pure barley 
malt, which, after fermentation, i s dis- 
tilled in a pot still, concentrated in 
another pot still to the proper strength, 
placed in wood, and stored for a number 
of years. Barley malt is too expensive a 
source of alcohol to justify its use fop 
industrial purposes. It is, however, one 
of the cheapest and best methods of 
converting the starch of other cereals 
into sugar preparatory to fermentation. 

Barley has, in round numbers, about 
68 per cent of fermentable matter. The 
weight of a bushel of barley (48 pounds) 
multiplied by 0.68 gives 32 pounds of 
fermentable matter in a bushel of barley. 

Cassava. — Cassava is gTOwn over a 
large area of the South Atlantic and Gulf 
States of this country. Of all the sub- 
stances which have been mentioned, ex- 
cept the cereals, cassava contains the 
largest amount of alcoholic or ferment- 
able substances. The root, deprived o\ 
its outer envelope, contains a .little over

per cent alcohol, or 143 gallons of 9o per 
cent alcohol per acre. - t 

Corn {Indian Corn or Maize).— I 
crop which at the present time is the 
source of almost all of the alcohol made 
in the United States is Indian corn. _ 

The fermentable matter in Indian 
corn _that is, the part which is capable 
of being converted into alcohol — amounts 
to nearly 70 per cent of the total weight, 
since the unfermentatale cellulose and 
pentosans included in carbohydrates do 
not exceed 2 per cent. Inasmuch as a 
bushel of Indian corn weighs 56 pounds, 
the total weight of fermentable matter 
therein, in round numbers, is 39 pounds. 
The weight of the alcohol which is pro- 
duced under the best conditions is little 
less than one-half of the fermentable 
matter. Therefore the total weight of 
alcohol which would be yielded by a 
bushel of average Indian corn would be, 
round numbers, about 19 pounds. 
The weight of a gallon of 95 per cent al- 
cohol is nearly 7 pounds. Hence 1 bush- 
el of corn would produce 2.7 gallons. 

If the average price of Indian corn be 
Placed, in round numbers, at 40 cents a 
misbel, the cost of the raw material — 
t&at is, of the Indian corn — for manu- 
facturing 95 per cent industrial alcohol 
h Sj 1 15 cents a gallon. To this must 
H ac T ed the cost of manufacture, stor- 
Se, etc., which is perhaps as much more, 
~ H the estimated actual cost of in- 
ttai t alcoho1 of 95 per cent strength 
,, om Indian corn about 30 cents 
iirnfit ? n ', lf t0 tnis fa e added the 
iW ° f , manufacturer and dealer, 
appears that under the conditions cited, 
ytrial alcohol, untaxed, should be 
Si°T ab °ut 40 cents per gallon. 
^° ta£oea — The weight of a bushel of 



potatoes is 60 pounds. As the average 
amount of fermentable matter in potatoes 
grown in the United States is 20 per 
cent, the total weight of fermentable 
matter in a bushel of potatoes is 12 
pounds, which would yield approximate- 
ly 6 pounds or 3.6 quarts of alcohol. 

The quantity of starch in American- 
grown potatoes varies from 15 to 20 per 
cent. Probably 18 per cent might be 
stated as the general average of the best 
grades of potatoes. 

Under the microscope the granules of 
potato starch have a distinctive appear- 
ance. They appear as egg-shaped bodies 
on which, especially the larger ones, 
various ring-like lines are seen. With a 
modified light under certain conditions 
of observation a black cross is developed 
upon the granule. It is not difficult for 
an expert microscopist to distinguish 
potato from other forms of starch by 
this appearance. 

The potato contains very little ma- 
terial which is capable of fermentation 
aside from starch and sugars. 

Although the potato is not sweet to 
the taste in a fresh state, it contains not- 
able quantities of sugar. This sugar is 
lost whenever the potato is used for 
starch-making purposes, but is utilized 
when it is used for the manufacture of 
industrial alcohol. The percentage of 
sugar of all kinds in the potato rarely 
goes above 1 per cent. The average 
quantity is probably not far from 0.35 
per cent, including sugar, reducing 
sugar, and dextrin, all of which are 
soluble in water. In the treatment ot 
potatoes for starch making, therefore, it 
may be estimated that 0.35 per cent of fer- 
mentable matter is lost in the wash water. 

Average Composition.— The average 
composition of potatoes is : 

Water 75,00 per cent

an average content of fermentable mat- 
ter of about 20 per cent may be reason--

approximately 10 pounds of industrial 
alcohol can be made from 100 pounds of 



, f 

potatoes. Yf60 pounds be taken as the 
average weight of a bushel of potatoes, 
there are found therein 12 pounds oi 
fermentable matter, from which 6 pounds 
of industrial alcohol can be produced, or 
f of a gallon. It has also been shown 
that the amount of Indian corn neces- 
sary for the production of a gallon of in- 
dustrial alcohol costs > not^ less than 15 
cents. From this it is evident that the 
potatoes for alcohol making will have to 
oe produced at a cost not to exceed 15 
cents per bushel, before they can com- 
pete with Indian corn for the manufac- 
ture of industrial alcohol. 

Rice. — Rice is not used to any great 
extent in this country for making alco- 
hol, but _ it is extensively used for this 
purpose in Japan and some other coun- 
tries, and has the largest percentage of 
fermentable matter of all the cereais. 
The percentage of fermentable matter in 
nee is nearly 78 per cent. A bushel of 
( rice weighs, unhulled, 45 pounds, hulled, 
56 pounds, and it therefore has about 34 
and 43 pounds, respectively, of ferment- 
ab e matter for the unhulled and the 
nulled rice. It is not probable that rice 
will ever be used to any extent in this 
country as a source of industrial alcohol, 
although it is used to a large extent in the 
manufacture of beverages, as for in- 
stance m beers, which are often made 
Partly of rice. 

nK?fl 6 '~ L L rf i e qualities of alcohol, 
chiefly m the form of alcoholic beverages, 
are manufactured from rye. It is, in 



connection with Indian corn, the n 
cipal source of the whiskies made hi a 
United States. _ Rye, however, is not * 
to any extent in this or other countril 
for making industrial alcohol. 

Rye contains almost as much ferm ent 
able matter as Indian corn. A bushel of 
rye weighs 56 pounds. Wheat and other 
cereals, not mentioned above, are not 
used in this country to any appreciable 
extent in the manufacture of alcohol 

Spelt. — This grain, which is botanic- 
ally a variety of wheat, more closely 
resembles barley. Under favorable eon- 
ditions as much as 73 bushels per acre 
have been reported, and analyses show 
70 per cent of_ fermentable carbohy- 
drates. The weight per bushel is about 
the same as that of oats. It would ap- 
pear that this crop might be worthy o{ 
consideration as a profitable source of 
industrial alcohol. 

Sugar Beets.— The sugar beet is often 
used directly as a source of alcohol. 
Working on a practical scale in France, 
it has been found that from 10,430 tons 
of beets there were produced 183,024 
gallons of crude alcohol of 100 percent 
strength. The beets contain 11.33 per 
cent of sugar. From 220 pounds of sugar 
15.64 gallons of alcohol were produced. 
The weight of pure alcohol obtained is a 
little less than one-half the weight of the 
dry fermentable matter calculated as 
sugar subjected to fermentation. About 
18 gallons of alcohol are produced for 
each ton of sugar beets employed.

Utilization of Waste Material or By- 
products. — Molasses. — The utilization 
of the waste materials from the sugar 
factories and sugar refineries for the pur- 
pose of making alcohol is a wel -es- 
tablished industry. The use of these 
sources of supply depends, of course, 
upon the cost of the molasses. When 
the sugar has been exhausted as fully as 
possible from the molasses the latter 
consists of a saccharine product, contain- 
ing a considerable quantity of unferment- 
afale carbohydrate matter, large quan- 
tities of mineral salts, and water. In 
molasses of this hind there is probably 
not more than 50 pounds of fermentable 
matter to 100 pounds of the product. 
Assuming that a gallon of such molasses 
weighs 11 pounds, it is seen that it con- 
tains 5i pounds of fermentable matter, 
yielding 2} pounds of industrial alcohol 
of 95 per cent strength. It requires 
about 3 gallons of such molasses to make 
1 gallon of industrial alcohol. 

When the price of molasses delivered to 
the refineries falls as low as 5 or 6 cents a 
gallon it may be considered a profitable 
source of alcohol. 

Wood Pulp and Sawdust. — Many at- 
i m ? ls . bave been made to produce 
alcohol for industrial purposes from 
sawdust wood pulp, or waste wood 
material. The principle of the process 
rests upoil the fact that the woody sub- 
k; TV S com POsed of cellulose and 
snared matters which, under the action 
"lute acid (preferably sulphuric or 
ur ous) an d heat, with or without 



(mute acid (preferably sulphuric or 
juiphnrous) an d heat, with or without 
cW • under Ko hydrolysis and are 
the mt ° su gars. A large part of 
fe f U Pui which is formed is non- 
rentable, consisting of a substance 



known as xylose. Another part of the 
sugar produced is dextrose, made from 
the true cellulose which the wood 
contains.^ 

The yield of alcohol in many of the 
experiments which have been made has 
not been very satisfactory. It is claimed, 
however, by some authors that paying 
quantities of alcohol are secured. In 
Simraonsen's process for the manu- 
facture of alcohol | per cent sulphuric 
acid is employed and from 4 to 5 parts 
of the liquid heated with 1 part of the 
finely comminuted wood for a quarter of 
an hour under a pressure of 9 atmos- 
pheres. It is claimed by Simmonsen 
that he obtained a yield of 6 quarts of 
alcohol from 110 pounds of air-dried 
shavings. Another process which has 
been tried in this and other countries for 
converting comminuted wood into alcohol 
is known as Classen's. The comminuted 
wood is heated for 15 minutes in a closed 
apparatus at a temperature of from 248* 
to 293° F. in the presence of sulphurous 
acid (fumes of burning sulphur) instea ' 
of sulphuric acid. It is claimed by the 
inventor that he has made as much as 1 
quarts of alcohol from 110 pounds of th 
air-dried shavings. There is reason t 
doubt the possibility of securing sue 
high yields in actual practice as are 
claimed in the above processes. Tha 
alcohol can be made from sawdust and 
wood shavings is undoubtedly true, but 
whether or not it can be made profitably 
must be determined by actual manu- 
facturing operations. m 

Waste Products of Canneries, etc.— It* 
principal waste materials winch may b 
considered in this connection are th 
refuse of wine making., fruit evaporating, 
and canning industries especially the 
waste of factories devoted to the can 
Tng of tomatoes and Indian corn. I

Manufacture of Alcohol — The three 
principal steps in the manufacture of 
alcohol are (1) the preparation of th» 
m ash or wort, (2) the fermentation of tW 
mash or wort drawn off from the m as u 
tun, and (3) the distillation of the dilute 
alcohol formed m the beer or wash from 
the fermentation tanks. The prepara- 
tion of the mash includes (1) the treat- 
ment of the material used with hot water 
to form a paste of the starch or the sugar 
. and (2) the action of the malt or ferment

render it profitable to engage in the 
manufacture. A smaller percentage could 
be expected from the waste of the to- 
mato, where the quantity of sugar is 
not so great. In the waste of the sweet- 
corn factory the amount of ferment- 
able matter would depend largely on the 
care with which the grain was removed. 
There is usually a considerable quantity 
of starchy material left on the cobs, and 
this, with the natural sugars which the 
grown cobs contain, might yield quite 
large Quantities of fermentable matter. 
It would not be profitable to erect dis- 
tilleries simply for the utilization of 
Z this knd, but if these wastes

Scotland are called "wash backs," when

often have a stirring apparatus as in- 
dicated in the figure whereby the con- 
tents can be thoroughly mixed with the 
yeast and kept in motion. This, is not 
necessary after the fermentation is once 
well established, but it is advisable, 
especially in the early stages, to keep the 
yeast well distributed throughout the 
mass. In these tanks the fermentations 
are conducted, the temperature being 
varied according to the nature of the 
product to be made. For industrial 
alcohol the sole purpose should be to 
secure the largest possible percentage of 
alcohol without reference to its palatable 
properties. 

An organism belonging to the vege- 
table family and to^ which the name 
"yeast" has been given is the active 
agent in fermentation. The organism 
itself does not take a direct part in the 
process, but it secretes another ferment 
of an unorganized character known as 
an "enzym" or a "diastase." This en- 
zym has the property, under proper 
conditions of food, temperature, and 
dilution, of acting upon sugar and con- 
verting it into alcohol and carbonic acid. 
Anyone who has ever seen a fermenting 
vat in full operation and noticed the 
violent boiling or ebullition of the liquor, 
can understand how rapidly the gas 
_ carbon dioxide" or "carbonic acid," as 
it is usually called, may be formed, as it 
is the escape of this gas which gives the 
appearance to the tank of being in a 
V1 ^-u t State of ebullition. The yeast 
which produces the fermentation belongs 
to the same general family as the ordi- 
nary yeast which is used in the leavening 
ot bread. The leavening of bread under 
the action of yeast is due to the conver- 

j su ? ar in tlle d ough into 
alcohol and carbon dioxide or carbonic 
ine gas thus formed becomes 



acid.

mass to swell or rise, as it is common W 
expressed. Starch cannot be directly 
fermented, but must be first converted 
into sugar, either by the action of a 
chemical like an acid, or a ferment or 
enzym, known as diastase, which is 0 a e 
of the abundant constituents of malt 
especially of barley malt. In the p rep ! 
aration of a cereal, for instance, f or 
fermentation, it is properly softened and 
ground, and then usually heated with 
water to the boiling point or above in 
order that the starch may be diffused 
throughout the water. After cooling, it j s 
treated with barley malt, the diastase of 
which acts vigorously upon the starch, 
converting it into a form of sugar] 
namely, maltose, which , lends itself 
readily to the activities of the yeast fer- 
mentation. (Fig. 4.)

When ordinary sugar (cane sugar,

of converting the starch and sugar into

and yield. On the other hand, when 
alcoholic beverages are to be made, those 
processes must be employed, irrespective 
of the magnitude of the yield, which give 
the finest and best flavors to the products. 

Distillation. — The object of distilla- 
tion is to separate the alcohol which has 
been formed from the non volatile sub- 
stances with which it is mixed. Atypical 
form of distilling apparatus for the con- 
centration of the dilute alcohol which is 
formed in the beer or wash from the fer- 
mentation tanks, is represented in Fig. 5. 

This apparatus is of the continuous 
type common to Europe and America. 
It consists of a "beer still" provided with 
a number of chambers fitted with per- 
forated plates and suitable overflow pipes. 
It is operated as follows: 
. The syrup and alcohol are pumped 
into the top of the beer still through a 
P'pe (?; the tank G may also be placed 
above the center of the still and the con- 
tents allowed to flow into the still by 
gravity; steam is admitted through an 
open p ipe into the kettle A at the bottom

also divided into chambers, but by solid

When the still is in operation the temper-

ing to the required density of the alco- 
hol The object of the "goose" is the 
return to the' column of all low products 
which condense at a temperature be- 
low the boiling point of ethyl alcohol 
of the desired strength. On leaving the 
"goose" the vapors enter a condenser E, 
whence the liquid alcohol is conducted 
into a separator F. This separator con- 
sists simply of a glass box provided with 
a cylinder through which a current of 
alcohol is constantly flowing. An alcohol 
spindle is inserted in this cylinder and 
shows the density of the spirit at all 
times. A pipe, with a funnel-shaped 
opening at its upper extremity, connects 
with the pipe leading from the condens- 
er and gives vent to any objectionable 
fumes. The separator is connected by 
means of a pipe with the alcohol storage 
tank, The pipe 0 is for emptying the 
upper chambers when necessary. The 
valves TV, communicating by means of a 
small pipe with a condenser M, are for 
testing the vapors in the lower chambers 
for alcohol. 

Substances Used for Denaturing 
Alcohol. — The process of rendering al- 
cohol unsuitable for drinking is called 
' denaturing," and consists, essentially, in 
adding to the alcohol a substance soluble 
therein of a bad taste or odor, or both, 
ot an intensity which would render it im- 
possible or impracticable to use the mix- 
ture as a drink. Among the denaturing 

the follow- WhlCh haVC been P ro P° sed are 

S * eUac (with or without the ad- 
miS °+ \ Cam P hor ' turpentine, wood

acid, caustic soda, musk, anirnal 
etc. 



oils, 



zine 



Methyl (wood) alcohol and ben. 
are the denaturing agents authorized ]r 
the United States, in the following PT J; 
portions: To 100 parts, by volume 0 f 
ethvl alcohol (not less than 90 per cent 
strength) add 10 parts of approved 
methyl (wood) alcohol and y 2 0 f l part 
of approved benzine. Such alcohol i s 
classed as completely denatured. Forrnn- 
las for special denaturation may be sub- 
mitted for approval by manufacturers 
to the Commissioner of Internal Rev- 
enue, who will determine whether they 
may be used or not, and only one spe- 
cial denaturant will be authorized for the 
same class of industries unless it shall 
be shown that there is good reason for 
additional special denaturants. Not less 
than 300 wine gallons can be withdrawn 
from a. bonded warehouse at one time 
for denaturing purposes. 

Spirit. — Proof spirit is a term used by 
the revenue department in assessing the 
tax on alcoholic liquors. It means a 
liquid in which there is 50 per cent (by 
volume) of absolute alcohol. As it is 
the actual alcohol in the whisky, brandy, 
dilute alcohol, etc., which is taxed, and as 
this varies so widely, it is necessary that 
the actual wine gallons be converted into 
proof gallons before the tax rate can be 
fixed. A sample that is half alcohol 
and half water (let us say for conven- 
ience) is 'TOO proof." A sample that is 
% alcohol and % water is 150 proof, ana 
the tax on every gallon of it is 1% tm ™ 
tha regular government rate per p r0 
gallon. Absolute alcohol is 200 V mi 
and has to pay a double tax. 

The legal definition of proof spin ,

Sterilization of Sponges.— I— Allow 
ae sponges to lie for 24 hours in an 8 
"r cent hydrochloric acid solution, to 
eliminate lime and coarse impurities; 
wash in clean water, and place the 
sponges in a solution of caustic potash, 
10 parts; tannin, 10 parts; and water, 
1 000 parts. After they have been sat- 
urated for 5 to 20 minutes with this 
liquid, they are washed out in steril- 
ized water or a solution of carbolic acid 
or corrosive sublimate, until they have 
entirely lost the brown coloring acquired 
by the treatment with tannin. The 
sponges thus sterilized are kept in a 2 per

Sponge Window Display. — Soak a large 
piece of coarse sponge in water, squeeze 
half dry, then sprinkle in the openings 
red clover seed, millet, barley, lawn grass, 
oats, rice, etc. Hang this in the window, 
where the sun shines a portion of the day, 
and sprinkle lightly with water daily. It 
will soon form a mass of living green 
vegetation very refreshing to the eyes. 
While the windows are kept warm this 
may be done at any season. The seeds 
used may be varied, according to fancy.

able pigment. After dusting the powder 
through the perforated pattern it is fixed 
on the fabric by laying over it a piece of 
paper and then passing a hot iron care- 
fully over the paper. By this means the 
rosin is melted and the mixture adheres. 
When white goods are to be "stamped," 
ultramarine is commonly used as the 
Pigment; for dark goods, zinc white may 
be substituted. Especial care should be 
taken tc avoid lead compounds and other 
poisonous pigments, as they may do 
mischief by dusting off. On velvets or 
other materials likely to be injured by 
neat, stamping is said to be done by 
moistening a suitable powder with alco- 
u j ^ s - in S Jt as stencil paint. A 
small addition of roainous matter would 
seem required here also.

Place several new pie tins on a fevei 
table, coat them slightly with sweet oil 
and pour about 6 tableapoonfuls of the 
melted paraffine wax into each tin. The 
pan may be floated in water sufficient 
to permit the mixture to be cut or 
stamped out with a tin cutter into small 
cakes about the size of a peppermint 
lozenge. Two of these cakes added to 
each pint of starch will cause the smooth- 
ing iron to impart the finest possible 
finish to muslin or linen, besides perfum- 
ing the clothes.

All these are to be intimately mixed in 
the powder form by sifting through a 
sieve several times. As the wax is in a 
solid form and does not readily become 
reduced to powder by pounding in a mor- 
tar, the best method of reducing it to 
such a condition is to put the wax into a 
bottle with some sulphuric or recti** 
ether and then allow the fluid to CTJ?
