2ft* 6 hours tne clippings are taken out 
and the iron completely dissolved m 
dSute sulphuric acid; the residue of tin 
is then combined with the tin obtained by 
the electrolysis. Green vitriol is there- 
fore a bv-product. in this process. _ 

Gutensohn's process has two objects: 
To obtain tin and to render the ironnt 
for use. The tin is obtained by treating 
the tinned plate repeatedly with hydro- 
chloric acid. The tin is then removed 
from the solution by means of the electric 
current. The tinned plate as the positive 
pole is placed in a tank made of some in- 
sulating material impervious to the action 
of acids, such as slate. A copper plate 
forms the cathode. The bichloride of 
tin solution, freed from acid, is put round 
the carbon cylinder in the Bunsen ele- 
ment. Another innovation in this proc- 
ess is that the tank with the tinned- 
plate clippings is itself turned into an 
electric battery with the aid of the tin. 
A still better source of electricity is, how- 
ever, obtained during the treatment of 
the untinned iron which will be de- 
scribed presently. The final elimination 
™ the tin takes place in the clay cup 
°t the Bunsen elements. Besides the 
chloride of tin solution (free from acid), 
another tin solution, preferably chromate 
01 tin, nitrate of tin, or sulphate of tin, 
according to the strength of the current 
aesired, may be used. To render the 
R °n ?f the tinned plate serviceable the 
acid is drawn off as long as the iron is 
coy ered with a thin layer of an alloy of 
S 4 a ? d tin - The latter makes the iron 
^\j.o r use in rolling mills or for the 
er. 



chloric acid or sulphuric acid is there- 
fore poured over the plate to remove the 
alloy, after the treatment with the bi- 
chloride of tin solution. This acid is 
also systematically used in different vats 
to the point of approximate saturation. 
This solution forms the most suitable 
source of electricity, a zinc-iron element 
being formed by means of a clay cell and 
a zinc cylinder. The electrical force 
developed serves to accelerate the solu- 
tion in the next tank, which contains 
tinned plate, either fresh or treated with 
hydrochloric acid. Ferrous oxide, or 
spongy metallic iron if the current is 
very strong, is liberated in the iron bat- 
tery. Both substances_ are easily oxi- 
dized, and form red oxide of iron when 
heated. The remaining solution can be 
crystallized by evaporation, so that fer- 
rous sulphate (green vitriol) or ferric 
chloride can be obtained, or it can b( 
treated to form red oxide of iron.

TIRE: 

Anti-Leak Rubber Tire.— Pneumatic 
tires can be made quite safe from punc- 
tures by using a literal amount of the 
following cheap mixture: One pound at 
sheet glue dissolved in hot water in the 
usual manner, and 3 pints of molasses. 
This mixture injected into the tire 
through the valve stem, semi-hardens into 
an elastic jelly, being, in fact, about the 
same as the well-known ink roller com- 
position used for the rollers of printing 
presses. This treatment will usually be 
found to effectually stop leaks in punc- 
tured or porous tires.

TOOL SETTING. 

The term "setting" (grinding) j 8 a 
plied to the operation of giving an edp" 
to the tools designed for cutting, S( . r .f e 
Cutting tools — - 



1 



ing, or sawmg. cutting tools are rubb^ 
either on flat sandstones or on rapidW 
turned grindstones. The wear on the 
faces of the tools diminishes their thick- 
ness and rendeis the cutting an „ig 
sharper. Good edges cannot be J D , 
tained except with the aid of the grind, 
stone; it is therefore important to select 
this instrument with care. It should be 
soft, rather than hard, of fine, smooth 
grain, perfectly free from seams or 
flaws. The last condition is essential 
for it often happens that, under the in- 
fluence of the revolving motion, a de- 
fective stone suddenly yields to the 
centrifugal force, bursts and scatters its 
pieces with such violence as to wound 
the operator. This accident may also 
happen with perfectly formed stones. 
On this account artificial stones have 
been substituted, more homogeneous and 
coherent than the natural ones. 

Whatever may be the stone selected, it 
ought to be kept constantly moist during 
the operation. If not, the tools will 
soon get heated and their temper will be 
impaired. When a tool has for a certain 
time undergone the erosive action of the 
stone, the cutting angle becomes too 
acute, too thin, and bends over on itseii, 
constituting what is called "the feather 
edge." This condition renders a new 
setting necessary, which is usually ef- 
fected by bending back the fearer edge, 
if it is long and whetUng the blade 
on a stone called a setter. j^tr 
several varieties of stones used tor w _ 
purpose, though they are mostly co

Iwia* solution of gelatin, kept tor use 
fn zinc vessel, the gelatin solution is 
Poured on the glass plates destined for 
the transparencies. After a quarter 01 
an hour, take the placard, moisten its 
back un formly, and lay it upon a gela- 
film which 'has meanwhile formed 
on the glass plate, where it remains 8 to 
8 days When it is to be removed from 
the plate, the edge of the gelatin film 
protruding over the edge of the placard 
fs lifted up with a dull knife, and it is 
thus drawn off. A fine, transparent gloss 
remains on the placard proper. In order 
to render the covering waterproot and 
pliable, it is given a coating of eollodion, 
which does not detract from the trans- 
parence. The glass plates and their 
frames must be cleaned of adhering gela- 
tin particles before renewed use. 

TRANSFER PROCESSES: 

To Transfer Designs. — Designs can be 
transferred on painted surfaces, cloth, 
leather, velvet, oil cloth, and linen 
sharply and in all the details with little 
trouble. Take the original design, lay 
it on a layer of paper, and trace the lines 
of design accurately with a packing 
needle, the eye of which is held by a piece 
of wood for a handle. It is necessary 
to press down well. The design be- 
comes visible on the back by an eleva- 
tion. When everything has "been accu- 
rately pressed through, take, e. g., for dark 
objects,_ whiting (formed in pieces), lay 
the design face downward on the knee 
and pass mildly with the whiting over 
the elevations; on every elevation a chalk 
line will appear. Then dust off the 
superfluous whiting with the fingers, lav 
the whiting side on the cloth to hold it 
so that it cannot slide, and pass over it 
with a soft brush. For light articles 
take powdered lead pencil, which is 
rubbed on with the finger, or limewood 
Sif 0 j T F ?- r facing use oil paint on 
cloth and India ink on linen. 



To Copv- Engravings.

-To make a 



a warm, closed box to the v a p ot - 
iodine, then place it, inkside downward 
on a smooth, dry sheet of clean whit 
paper, which has been brushed w i t L 
starch water. After the two prep are j 
surfaces have been in contact for a short 
time a facsimile of the engraving will be 
reproduced more or less accurately, ae . 
cording to the skill of the operator. 

To Transfer Engravings.— The beat 
way to transfer _ engraving from on e 
piece to another is to rub transfer was 
into the engraved letters. This wax is 
made of beeswax, 3 parts; tallow, 3 
parts; Canada balsam, 1 part; olive oil, 
1 part. If the wax becomes too hard, 
add a few drops of olive oil, and if too 
soft, a little more beeswax. Care should 
be taken that the wax does not remain 
on the surface about the engraving, 
otherwise the impression would be blurred. 
Then moisten a piece of paper by draw- 
ing it over the tongue and lay it on the 
engraving. Upon this is laid another 
piece of dry paper, and securing hoth 
with the thumb and forefinger of the 
left hand, so they will not be moved, 
go over the entire surface with a bur- 
nisher made of steel or bone, with a 
pointed end. This will press the lower 
paper into the engraving and cause the 
wax to adhere to it. Then the top paper 
is removed and the corner of the lower 
one gently raised. The whole is then 
carefully peeled off, and underneath 
will be found a reversed, sharp impres- 
sion of the engraving. The edges oi the 
paper are then cut so it can be httea 10 
i position on the other articles nuuW 
to that on the original one. When W 
is done lay the paper in the proPja Mg» 
lion and rub the index finger Ijfg^J 
it, which will transfer a is 
the original engraving. 11 , ^ f can 
taken two dozen or more transrei 
be made from a single impression.

Permanent (Record) Ink.— Any finely

should be used. To make black record 
ink: Take some vaseline, melt it on a 
slow fire or water bath, and incorporate 
by constant stirring as much lampblack 
as it will take up without becoming 
granular. Take from the fire and allow 
it to cool. The ink is now practical y 
finished, except, if not entirely suitable 
on trial, it may be improved by adding 
the corrigent wax in small quantity. 
The ribbon should be charged with a 
very thin, evenly divided amount of ink. 
Hence the necessity of a solvent — in this 
instance a mixture of equal parts of 
petroleum benzine and rectified spirit of 
turpentine. In this mixture dissolve a 
sufficient amount of the solid ink by 
vigorous agitation to make a thin paint. 
Try the ink on one extremity of the 
ribbon; if too soft, add a little wax to 
Qake it harder; if too pale, add more color- 
tog matter; if too hard, add more vaseline. 
If carefully applied to the ribbon, and 
the excess brushed off, the result will be 
satisfactory. 

® n the same principle, other colors 
m ^y be made into ink; but for delicate 
ll h albol ene and bleached wax 
snould be the vehicle and corrigent, 
r e3pectively. 

. The various printing inks may be used 
i prop er ly corrected. They require the 
Qtlition of vaseline to make them non- 
if f g ? n tile ribbon, and of some wax 
Li V?° soft. Where printing inks 
e ava dable. they will be found to give 



excellent results if thus modified, as the 
pigment is well milled and finely divided. 
Even black cosmetic may be made to 
answer, by the addition of some lamp- 
black to the solution in the mixture of 
benzine and turpentine. 

After thus having explained the prin- 
ciples underlying the manufacture of 
permanent inks, we can pass more rapidly 
over the subject of copying inks, which 
is governed by the same general rules. 

For copying inks, aniline colors form 
the pigment; a mixture of about 3 parts, 
of water and 1 part of glycerine, the 
vehicle; transparent soap (about \ part), 
the corrigent; stronger alcohol (about 6 
parts), the solvent. The desired aniline 
color will easily dissolve in the hot 
vehicle, soap will give the ink the neces- 
sary body and counteract the hygrc 
scopic tendency of the glycerine, and i 
the stronger alcohol the ink will readi. 
dissolve, so that it can be applied in i 
finely divided state to the ribbon, whei 
the evaporation of the alcohol will leai 
it in a thin film. There is little more 1 
add. After the ink is made and tried- 
if too soft, add a little more soap; if tc 
hard, a little more glycerine; if too pal 
a little more pigment Printer s copj 
ins ink can be utilized here likewise. 

TJsers of the typewriter should so set 
fresh ribbon as to start at the edge ncs 
est the operator, allowing it to run bac

This should never be done, as it 
var ably springs or forces the valve seats 
from tlfeir true original bearing with the 
disks. 

TV —Never place the body of a valve 
m the vise to remove the bonnet or center- 
piece from a valve, as it will squeeze 
together the soft brass body and throw 
all parts out of alignment. Properly to 
remove the bonnet or centerpiece trom 
a valve, either screw into each end of the 
valve a short piece of pipe and place one 
piece of the pipe in the vise, using a ■ 
wrench on the square of bonnet; or if the 
vise is properly constructed, place the 
square of the bonnet in same and use 
the short piece of pipe screwed in each 
end as a lever. When using a wrench 
•on square of bonnet or centerpiece, use 
a Stillson or Trimo wrench with a piece 
of tin between the teeth of the jaws and 
the finished brass. It may mark the brass 
slightly, but this is preferable to round- 
ing off all the corners with an old monkey 
wrench which is worn out and sprung. 
As the threads on all bonnets or center- 
pieces are doped with litharge or cement, 
a sharp jerk or jar on the wrench will 
start tne bonnet much more quickly 
than a steady pull. Under no circum- 
stances try to replace or remove the 
bonnet or centerpiece of a valve without 
hrst opening it wide. This will prevent 
the bending of the stem, forcing the disk 
down through the seat or stripping the 
threads on bonnet where it screws into 
body. If it is impossible to remove bon- 
net or centerpiece bv ordinary methods, 
neat the body of the valve just outside 
the thread. Then tap lightly all around 
me thread with a soft hammer. This 
method never fails, as the heat expands 
ie body ring and breaks the joint made 
"je or cement. 



V. — The application of B j 
monkey wrench to the stuffing bo x g 0 *

the stuffing boxes split, or the threads in

g-inch horizontal pipe from a 2-ineh 
valve connected to main steam header 
the pipe being about 18 feet long, after 
he has screwed the pipe tightly into the 
valve, he leaves the helper to support the 
pipe at the other end, while he gets the 
banger ready. The helper in the mean- 
time has become tired and drops his 

j shoulder on which the pipe rests about 
3 inches and in consequence the full 
I weight of this 18-foot length of pipe 
bears on the valve. The valve is badly 
sprung and when the engineer raises 
steam the next morning the valve leaks. 
"When a valve is placed in the center of a 
long run of pipe, the pipe on eaek side, 
and close to the valve, should be well 
supported. 

VII. — The use of pipe cement in 
valves. When it is necessary to use pipe 
cement in joints, this mixture should 
always be placed on. the pipe thread 
which screws into the valve, and never in 
the valve itself. If the cement

Vanilla 

(Se e also Essences and Extracts.) 
The best Mexican vanilla yields only 
in The neighborhood of 1.7 per cent of 
-iiL that from Reunion and Ua- 
SSS bout ^ per cent; and that 
from Java 2.75 per cent. There seems 
to be but little connection between the 
quantity of vanillin contained in vanilla 
pods and their quality as a flavor pro- 
ducer. Mexican beans are. esteemed 
the best and yet they contain far less 
than the Java. Those from Brazil and 
Peru contain much less than those trom 
Mexico, and yet they arc considered in- 
ferior in quality to most others. -L ne 
vanillin of the market is chiefly, if not 
entirely, artificial and is made from the 
coniferin of such pines and firs as abies 
excelsa, a. pectinata, pinus cembra, and 
p. strobus, as well as from the eugenol 
of cloves and allspice. Vanillin also ex- 
ists in asparagus, lupine seeds, the seeds 
of the common wild rose, asafctida, and 
gum benzoin. 

A. good formula for a vanilla extract is 
the following: 

Vanilla 1 ounce 

Tonka. . » % ounces 

Alcohol, deodor- 
ized 33 fluidounces 

Syrup 8 fluidounces 

Cut and bruise the vanilla, afterwards 
adding and bruising the Tonka; macerate

hol, with occasional agitation; pour off

To Detect Artificial Vanillin in 
Vanilla Extracts (see also Foods) . — There 
is no well-defined test for vanillin, but 
one can get at it in a negative way. The 
artificial vanillin contains vanillin iden- 
tical with the vanillin contained in the 
vanilla bean; but the vanilla bean, as the 
vanilla extract, contains among its many 
"extractive matters" which enter into the 
food and fragrant value of vanilla extract, 
certain rosins which can be identified with, 
certainty in analysis by a number of de- 
termining reactions. Extract made with- 
out true vanilla can be detected by nega- 
tive results in all these reactions. 

Vanilla beans contain 4 to 11 peT cent 
of this rosin. It is of a dark red to brown 
color and furnishes, about one-half the 
color of the extract of vanilla. This 
rosin is soluble in 50 per cent alcohol, 
so that in extracts of high grade, where 
sufficient alcohol is used, all rosin is kept 
in solution. In cheap extracts, where as 
little as 20 per cent of alcohol by volume 
is sometimes used, an alkali—usually 
potassium bicarbonate— is added to aic 
m getting rosin, gums, etc., m solution 
and to prevent subsequent turpiditj

performed by evaporating a small quan- 
tity of the extract to dryness, and melting 
the residue with caustic potash, irans- 
fer the fused mass to a test tube neu- 
tralize with hydrochloric acid, and add 
a few drops of ferric chloride solution. 
If Tonka be present in the extract, the 
beautiful violet coloration characteristic 
of salicylic acid will at once become evi- 
dent. 

Vanilla Substitute. — A substitute for 
vanilla extract is made from synthetic 
vanillin. The vanillin is simply dis- 
solved in diluted alcohol and the solution 
colored with a little caramel and sweet- 
ened perhaps with syrup. The follow- 
ing is a typical formula: 

Vanillin 1 ounce 

Alcohol 6 quarts 

Water 5 quarts 

Syrup 1 quart 

Caramel sufficient to color. 
An extract so made does not wholly 
represent the flavor of the hean; while 
vanillin is the chief flavoring constituent 
of the bean, there are present other sub- 
stances which contribute to the flavor; 
and connoisseurs prefer this combina- 
tion, the remaining members of which 
have not yet been made artificially.

Varnishes 

(Sec also Enamels, Glazes, Oils, Paints, 
Kust Preventives, Stains, and Water- 
proofing.) 

f rt Zf- rniSh is , a s °l uti on of resinous matter 
h«r^ 1I,? a d - e ? r ' lim P id ®uid capable of 
bardenmg without losing its transparency. 



It is used to give a shining, transparent 
hard, and preservative covering to tv, 
finished surface of woodwork, capable of 
resisting in a greater or less degree the 
influence of the air and moisture. T^j! 
coating, when applied to metal or mineral 
surfaces, takes the name of lacquer, and 
must be prepared from rosins at once 
more adhesive and tenacious than those 
entering into varnish. 

The rosins, commonly called g lims 
suitable for varnish are of two kinds-^ 
the hard and the soft. The hard varie- 
ties are copal, amber, and the lac rosins. 
The dry soft rosins arc juniper gum 
(commonly called sandarac), mastic, and 
dammar. The elastic soft rosins are 
benzoin, elemi, anime, and turpentine. 
The science of preparing varnish con- 
sists in combining these classes of rosins 
in a suitable solvent, so that each conveys 
its good qualities and counteracts the 
bad ones of the others, and in giving the 
desired color to this solution without 
affecting the suspension of the rosins, or 
detracting from the drying and harden- 
ing properties of the varnish. 

In spirit varnish (that made with alco- 
hol) the hard and the elastic gums mustbe 
mixed to insure tenderness and solidity, 
as the alcohol evaporates at once after 
applying, leaving the varnish wholly 
dependent on the gums for the tenacious 
and adhesive properties; and if the soft 
rosins predominate, the varnish will 
remain "tacky" for a long time, Spirit 
varnish, however good and convenient tc 
work with, must always be inferior to oil 
varnish, as the latter is at the same time 
more tender and more solid, for the oil in 
oxidizing and evaporating thickens ana 
forms rosin which continues its softening 
and binding presence, whereas in a spi 
varnish the alcohol is promptly diss 
patcd, and leaves the gums on the ^ 
face of the work in a more or less igr 
lar and brittle precipitate which en v 
readily and peels off. 4 in a

^flooded with benzine, carbon bisul- 
phide and various ether products which 
are next to worthless where wearing and 
durable properties are desired. 

Alcohol will hold in solution only 
about one-third of its weight in rosins. 
Turpentine must be added always last to 
spirit varnish. Turpentine m its clear 
recently distilled state will not mix witn 
alcohol, hut must first be oxidized by 
exposing it to the air in an uncorked 
bottle until a small quantity taken there- 
from mixes perfectly with alcohol. This 
usually takes from a month to six weeks. 
Mastic must be added last of all to the 
ingredients of spirit varnish, as it is not 
wholly soluble in alcohol but entirely, so- 
la a solution of rosins in alcohol. Spirit 
varnishes that prove too hard and brittle 
may he improved by the addition of 
either of the oils of turpentine, castor 
seed, lavender, rosemary, or spike, in the 
proportion required to bring the varnish 
to the proper temper. 

Coloring « Spirit " Varnishes. — In 
modern works the following coloring 
substances are used, separately and 
K* blends; Saffron (brilliant golden 
plow), dragon's blood (deep reddish 
orown), gamboge (bright yellow), Soco- 
mne or Bombay aloes (liver brown), 

Za i ' ivor y' and bone black ( bla ck), 
vl ? lwoQ d, pterocarpus santalinus, the 
neartwood (dark red), Indian sandal-' 
xZa Pterocarpus indica. the heart- 
wo °d (orange red), bra 



mica, the heart 
brazil wood (dark 



yellow), myrrh (yellowish to reddish 
brown; darkens on exposure), madder 
(reddish brown), logwood (brown), red 
scammony rosin (light red), turmerk 
(orange yellow), and many others ac- 
cording to the various shade3 desired. 

M a nu facturing Hints. — Glass, coarse- 
ly powdered, is often added to varnish 
when mixed in large quantities for the 
purpose of cutting the rosins and pre- 
venting them from adhering to the bot- 
tom and sides of the container. "When 
possible, varnish should always be com- 
pounded without the use of heat, as this 
carbonizes and otherwise changes the 
constituents, and, besides, danger always 
ensues from the highly inflammable 
nature of the material employed. How- 
ever, when heat is necessary, a water 
bath should always be used; the varnish 
should never fill the vessel over a half to 
three-fourths of its capacity. 

The Gums Used in Making Varnish.-_ 
Juniper gum or true sandarac comes in 
long, yellowish, dusty tears, and requires 
a high temperature for its manipulation 
in oil. The oil must be so hot as t» 
scorch a feather dipped into it, befoi 
this gum is added; otherwise the gum ; 
burned. Because of this, j uniper gum j 
usually displaced in oil varnish by em 
dammar. Both of these gums by the 
dryness, counteract the elasticity of oj 
as well as of other gums. The ^usua 
sandarac of commerce is a br ttle yeUoj

rather Tndiscriminately to various 
Sims and rosins. The East Indian or 
Scan is the tender copal, and is softer

and as crystal as a ruby. 1 his is sel- 
dom seen in the market, as is also the 
tear of gamboge, which, mixed with the 
tear of dragon's blood, is said to be the 
basis of the brilliant orange and gold 
varnish of the ancients. 

Of all applications used to adorn and 
protect the surface of objects, oil var- 
nishes or lacquers containing hard ros- 
ins are the best, as they furnish a hard, 
glossy coating which does not crack and 
is very durable even when exposed to wind 
and rain. 

To obtain a varnish of these desirable 
qualities the best old linseed oil, or 
varnish made from it, must be combined 
with the residue left by the dry distilla- 
tion of amber or very hard copal. This 
distillation removes a quantity of vola- 
tile oil amounting to one-fourth or one- 
fifth of the original weight. The residue 
is pulverized and dissolved in hot linseed- 
oil varnish, forming a thick, viscous, 
yellow-brown liquid, which, as a rule, 
must be thinned with oil of turpentine 
before being applied. 

Hard rosin oil varnish of this sort may 
conveniently be mixed with the solution 
of asphalt m the oil of turpentine with 
the aid of the simple apparatus described 
below, as the stiffness of the two liquids 
makes hand stirring slow and laborious. 
A cask is mounted on an axle which 
projects through both heads, but is 
inclined to the axis of the cask, so that 
when the ends of the axle are set in bear- 
ings i and the cask is revolved, each end 
of the cask will rise and fall alternately, 

cask will be thorough!/ mixed and 
churned in a shnrt- tW^o t-u 1, :„

of tur~— ' : *""" 



rpentme to give proper consbten 
ded and the rotation is prm+;„.. 



oil 

is added and the rotation is continue 
until the mixture is perfectly uniform 

To obtain the best and most durahl 
result with this mixed oil, rosin, and as 
pha.lt varnish it is advisable to dilute it 
freely with oil of turpentine and to a p P W 
3 or 3 coats, allowing each coat to drv 
before the next is put on. In this way a 
deep black and very glossy surface i s 
obtained which cannot be distinguished 
from genuine Japanese lacquer. 

Many formulas for making these 
mixed asphalt varnishes contain rosin— 
usually American rosin. The result is 
the production of a cheaper but inferior 
varnish. The addition of such soft 
rosins as elemi and copaiba, however, is 
made for another reason, and it im- 
proves the quality of the varnish for 
certain purposes. Though these rosins 
soften the lacquer, they also make it more 
elastic, and therefore more suitable for 
coating leather and textile fabrics, as it 
does not crack in consequence of repeated 
bending, rolling, and folding. 

In coloring spirit varnish the alcohol 
should always be colored first to the 
desired shade before mixing with the 
rosin, except where ivory or bane black 
is used. If the color is taken from a 
gum, due allowance for the same must 
be made in the rosins of the varnish. 
For instance, in a varnish based on 
mastic, 10 parts, and tender copal, 5 
parts, in 100 parts, if this is to be colored 
with, say, 8 parts of dragon's blood (or 
any other color gum), the rosins must t>e 
reduced to mastic, S parts, and tender 
copal, 4 parts. Eight parts of color gum 
are here equivalent to 3 parts of varmsn

Sifatodrj-ing; oil of turpentine takes 

awav the gloss of varnish. 
■ ^Wishing must be done only on 
smooth, clean surfaces, if a fine, mirror- 
like gloss is desired , 

3 Varnish must be poured only into 
clean vessels, and from these never back 
into the stationary vessels, if it has been 
in contact with the brush. Use only dry 
brushes for varnishing, which are not 
moist with oil of turpentine or linseed oil 
or varnish. , 

i. Apply varnishes of all kinds as uni- 
formly as possible; spread them out 
evenly on the surfaces so that they form 
neither too thick nor too thin a layer. 
If the varnish is put on too thin the coat- 
ing shows no gloss; if applied too thick 
it does not get even and does not form a 
smooth surface, but a wavy one. 

5. Like all oil-paint coatings, every 
eoat of varnish must be perfectly dry 
before a new one is put on; otherwise 
it is likely that the whole work will 
show cracks. The consumer of varnish 
is only too apt to blame the varnish for 
all defects which appear in his work or 
develop after some time, although this 
can. only be proven in rare cases. As a 
rule, the ground was not prepared right 
aQ dthe different layers of paint were not 
sufficiently dry, if the surfaces crack after 
a comparatively short time and have the 
a Ppearance of maps. The cracking of 
Paint must not be confounded with the 
cracking of the varnish, for the cracking 
oi the paint will cause the varnish to 
wack prematurely. The varnish has to 



slowly, and during the drying must be 
absolutely protected from dust, flies, etc., 
until they have reached that stage when 
we can pass the back of the hand or a 
finger over them- without sticking to it. 

The production of faultless varnishing 
in most cases depends on the accuracy 
of the varnisher, on the treatment of his 
brush, his varnish pot, and all the other 
accessories. A brush which still holds 
the split points of the bristles never var- 
nishes clear; they are rubbed off easily 
and spoil the varnished work. A brush 
which has never been used does not pro- 
duce clean work; it should be tried several 
times, and when it is found that the var- 
nishing accomplished by its use is neat 
and satisfactory it should be kept very 
carefully. 

The preservation of the brush is thus 
accomplished: First of all do not place it 
in oil or varnish, for this would form a 
skin, parts of which would adhere to it, 
rendering the varnished surface unclean 
and grainy; besides these skins there are 
other particles which accumulate in thf 
corners and cannot be removed by dust- 
ing off; these will also injure the work. 
In order to preserve the brush properly, 
insert it in a glass of suitable size through 
a cork in the middle of which a hole has 
been bored exactly fitting the handle. 
Into the glass pour a mixture of equal 
parts of alcohol and oil of turpentine, 
and allow only the point of the brush 
to touch the mixture, if at all, It tne 
cork is air-tight the brush cannot dry

Asphalt Varnishes. — Natural asphalt is 
not entirely soluble in any liquid. Al- 
cohol dissolves only a small percentage 
of it, ether a much larger proportion. 
The best solvents are benzol, benzine, 
rectified petroleum, the essential oils, 
and chloroform, which leave only a 
small residue undissolved. The em- 
ployment of ether as a solvent is im- 
practicable because of its low boiling 
point, 97° F., and great volatility. The 
varnish would dry almost under the 
brush. Chloroform is not open to this 
objection, but it is too expensive for 
ordinary use. Rectified petroleum is a 
good solvent of asphalt, but it is not a 
desirable ingredient of varnish because, 
though the greater part of it soon 
evaporates, a small quantity of less 
volatile substances, which is usually 
present in even the most thoroughly 
rectified petroleum, causes the varnish 
to remain "tacky" for a consi derable 
time and to retain a disagreeable odor 
much longer. Common coal-tar benzine 
is also a good solvent and has the merit 
of cheapness, but its great volatility 
makes the varnish dry too quickly for 
convenient use, especially in summer. 



The best solvent, probably, i s 0 ;\ Q , 
turpentine, which dissolves asphalt al 
moS t completely, producing a varnish 
which dries quickly and forms a perfect 
coating if the turpentine has been well 



coating if the turpentine nas been well 
rectified. The turpentine should he a 
"water white," or entirely colorless 
liquid of strong optical refractive power 
and agreeable odor, without a trace of 
smokiness. A layer I of an inch in depth 
should evaporate in a short time so com- 
pletely as to leave no stain on a gl asa 

But even solutions of the best Syrian 
asphalt in the purest oil of turpentine, 
if they are allowed to stand undisturbed 
for a long time in large vessels, deposit 
a thick, semi-fluid precipitate which a 
large addition of oil of turpentine fails to 
convert into a uniform thin liquid. It 
may be assumed that this deposit con- 
sists of an insoluble or nearly insoluble 
part of the asphalt which, perhaps, has 
been deprived of solubility by the action 
of light. Hence, in order to obtain a 
uniform solution, this thick part must be 
removed. This can be done, though 
imperfectly, by carefully decanting the 
solution after it has stood for a lone 
time in large vessels. This tedious and 
troublesc me process may be avoided by 
filtering the solution as it is made, by 
the following simple and quite satis- 
factory method: The solution is made in 
a large cask, lying on its side, with a 
round hole about 8 inches in 
its upper bilge. This opening is p» 
vided with a well-fitting cover, t tte

m For 'a perfect, quick-drying asphalt 
varnish the purest asphalt must be used, 
IS as Syrian, or the best Tnnic ad. 
Trinidad seconds, though better than 
some other asphalts, yield an inferior 
varnish, owing to the presence of mipur- 

lt6 0f artificial asphalt, the best ( for this 
purpose is the sort known as mineral 
caoutchouc," which is especially suit- 
able for the manufacture of elastic 
dressings for leather and other flexible 
substances. For wood and metal it is 
less desirable, as it never becomes as hard 
as natural asphalt. 



FORMULAS: 

I.— A solution of 1 part of caoutchouc 
in 16_ parts of oil of turpentine or kero- 
sene is mixed with a solution of 16 parts 
of copal in 8 parts of linseed-oil varnish. 
To the mixture is added a solution of 
i parts of asphalt in 3 or 4 parts of lin- 
seed-oil varnish diluted with 8 or 10 parts 
of oil of turpentine, and the whole is 
faltered. This is a fine elastic varnish. 

11. — Coal-tar asphalt, American as- 
phalt, rosin, benzine, each 20 parts; 
lmseed-oil varnish, oil of turpentine, coal- 
tar oil, eacu 10 p ar i s; binoxide of man- 
ganese, roasted lampblack, each 2 parts. 
•Lne solid ingredients are melted to- 
gether and mixed with the linseed-oil 
varnish, into which the lampblack has 
|f en stirred, and, finally, the other 
"quids are added. The varnish is 
atr ame d through tow. 

ai?u icycle f Varnish.— This is a spirit var- 
' aQ . preferably made by a cold proc- 



ess, and requires less technical knowl- 
edge than the preparation of fatty var- 
nishes. The chief dependence is upon 
the choice of the raw materials. These 
raw materials, copal, shellac, etc., are 
first broken up small and placed in a 
barrel adapted for turning upon an axis, 
with a hand crank, or with a belt and 
pulley from a power shaft. The barrel 
is of course simply mounted in a frame of 
wood or iron, whichever is the most con- 
venient. After the barrel has received 
its raw material, it may be started and 
kept revolving for 24 hours. Long in- 
terruptions in the turning must be care- 
fully avoided, particularly in summer, 
for the material in the barrel, when at 
rest, will, at this season, soon form a 
large lump, to dissolve which will con- 
sume much time and labor. To prevent 
the formation of a semi-solid mass, as 
well as to facilitate the dissolving of the 
gum, it would be well to put some hard, 
smooth stones into the barrel with the 
varnish ingredients.

Bottle Varnish. — Bottles may be made 
to exclude light pretty well by coating 
them with asphaltum lacquer or varnish. 
A formula recommended for this purpose 
is as follows: Dissolve asphaltum, 1 part, 
in light coal-tar oil, 2 parts, and add to 
the solution about 1 per cent of castor oil. 
This lacquer dries somewhat slowly, but 
adheres very firmly to the glass. As- 
phaltum lacquer may also be rendered 
less brittle by the addition of elemi. 
Melt together asphaltum, 10 parts, and 
elemi, 1 part, and dissolve the cold fused 
mass m light coal-tar oil, 12 parts. 

Araber-colored bottles for substances 
acted upon by the actinic rays of light 
may be obtained from almost any manu- 
facturer of bottles. 

Can Varnish.— Dissolve shellac, 15 
parts, by weight; Venice turpentine, 2 



parts, by weight; and sandarac, 8 paw, 
by weight, m spirit, 75 parts, by Weight. 

Copal Varnish.— Very fine copal Var 
rush for those parts of carriages wWi 
require the highest polish, is prepared as 
follows: 

I. — Melt 8 pounds best copal and roixwiH, 
gO pounds very clear matured oil. Then 
boil 4 to 5 hours at moderate heat until it 
draws threads; now mix with 35 pounds 
oil of turpentine, strain and keep For use 
This varnish dries rather slowly, there- 
fore varnishers generally mix it one-half 
with another varnish, which is prepared 
by boiling for 4 hours, 20 pounds clear 
linseed oil and 8 pounds very pure, white 
anime rosin, to which is subsequently 
added 35 pounds oil of turpentine. 
II. — Mix the following two varnishes: 

(a) Eight pounds copal, 10 pounds lin- 
seed oil, i pound dried sugar of lead, 3a 
pounds oil of turpentine. 

(b) Eight pounds good anime rosin, 10 
pounds linseed oil, \ pound zinc vitriol, 
35 pounds oil of turpentine. Each al 
these two sets is boiled separately into 
varnish and strained, and then both are 
mixed. This varnish dries in 6 hours in 
winter, and in 4 hours in summer. Fo< 
old articles which are to be re- varnished 
black, it is very suitable. 

Elastic Limpid Gum Varnishes.— I— 
In order to obtain a limpid rubber 
varnish, it is essential to have the rubber 
entirely free from water. This can .be 
obtained by cutting the rubber into thin 
strips, or better, into shreds as fine* 
possible, and drying them at a temp r

11— The following preparation pro- 
duces a brilliant surface on metals and 
b very durable, resisting the effect ot 
blows without scaling or chipping oil, 
and being therefore highly suitable tor 
cyclss and any other articles exposed to 
shock " 

For' the manufacture of U gallons, 11 
pounds of red copper, 8.8 pounds of yel- 
low copper, 4.4 pounds of hard steel, and 
4.4s pounds of soft steel, all in a com- 
minuted condition, are well washed in 
petroleum or mineral spirit, and are then 
treated with concentrated sulphuric acid 
in a lead-lined vessel, with continued 
stirring for 2 hours. After 12 hours' 
rest the sulphuric acid is neutralized 
with Javel extract, and the fine powder 
left in the vessel is passed through a silk 
sieve to remove any fragments of metal, 
then ground along with linseed oil, ivory 
Mack, and petroleum, the finely divided 
niass being afterwards filtered through 
nannel and incorporated with a mixture 
01 Bombay gum, 22 pounds- Damascus 
gum, ii pounds; Judea bitumen, 22 
Pounds; Norwegian tar rosin, 11 pounds; 
atld 11 pounds of ivory black ground 
j^ry fine j n re fi tled petroleum. When 
Perfectly homogeneous the mass is again 
pered, and is then ready for use. It is 
jam on with a brush, and then fixed by 
xpoaure to a temperature of between 
?" u arid 800° F. The ivory black may 
Replaced by other coloring matters, 
*ecotdmg to requirements. 



A Color Enamel. — On the piece to be 
enameled apply oil varnish or white lead, 
and add a powder giving brilliant re- 
flections, such as diamantine, brilliantine, 
or argentine. Dry in a stove. Apply a 
new coat of varnish. Apply the powder 
again, and finally heat in the oven. 



Afterwards, apply several layers of 
varnish; dry each layer in the oven. 
Apply pumice stone in powder or tripoli, 
and finally apply _ a layer of Swedish 
varnish, drying in the oven. This 
enamel does not crack. It adheres per- 
fectly, and is advantageous for the pieces 
of cycles and other mobiles. 

Cold Enameling. — This style of enam- 
eling is generally employed for repairing 
purposes. The various colors are either 
prepared with copal varnish and a little 
oil of turpentine, or else they are melted 
together with mastic and a trifle of oil of 
spike. In using the former, the surface 
usually settles down on drying, and 
ordinarily the latter is preferred, which 
is run on the cracked-off spot by warming 
the article. After the cooling, file the 
cold enamel off uniformly, and restore 
the gloss by quickly drawing it through 
the flame. For black cold enamel med 
mastic together with lampblack, which is 
easily obtained by causing the flame o 
a wick dipped into linseed oil to touch 
piece of tin.

enamel after the putty is dry. The 
varnish dries quickly is odorless and 
tasteless, and extraordinarily durable 
If a little annealed soot black is added 
to this vat enamel, a fine iron varnish is 
obtained which adheres very firmly. 
Leather (spattering leather on _ car- 
riages) can also be nicely varnished 
with it. 

Finishing Enamel for White Furni- 
ture, — Various methods are practiced 
in finishing furniture in white enamel, 
and while numerous preparations in- 
tended for the purpose named are gen- 
erally purchasable of local dealers in 
paint supplies, it is often really difficult, 
and frequently impossible, to obtain 
a first-class ready-made enamel. To 
prepare such an article take ^ pint of 
white lead and add to it J pint of pure 
turpentine, J gill of pale coach Japan, 
and ^ gill of white dammar varnish. 
Mix all the ingredients together thor- 
oughly. Apply with a camePs-hair brush, 
and for large surfaces use a 2-inch double 
thick brush. There should be at least 
three coats for good work, applied after 
an interval of 24 hours between coats; 
a &d for strictly high-class work four coats 
will be necessary. Each coat should be 
put on thin and entirely free from brush 
marks, sandpapering being carefully done 
upon each coat of pigment. Work that 
Has been already painted or varnished 
needs to be cut down with, say, No. * 
sandpaper, and then smoothed fine with 
fr£ J P ^ 6r - Then thm white lead to a 
r^r- nR , COnSlstenc y with turpentine, 

sirW ' af>p,y , two coats of ^ to the 
rface. Give each coat plenty of time 



to harden (36 hours should suffice) a n 
which sandpapering with No. H 'nt 
had best be done. Ordinarily, U p 0 £ f« 
coats of white lead, the enamel finish 
above detailed, may be successfully n ^ 
dueed. For the fine, rich enamel fin 
adapted to rare_ specimens of furnhv, 
and developed in the mansions of th 
multimillionaires, a more elaborate anJ 
complex process becomes necessary. 



Quick-Drying Enamel Colors, — En 
amel colors which dry quickly, but r c I 
mnin elastic so that applied on tin thev 
will stand stamping without crackin« off 
can be produced as follows: 

In a closed stirrer or rolling cask place 
21.5 parts, by weight, of finely powdered 
pale French rosin, 24J parts, by weight, 
of Manila copal, as well as 85 parts, by 
weight, of denaturized spirit (95 p er 
cent), causing the cask or the stirrer to 
' rotate until all the guni has completely 
dissolved, which, according to the tem- 
perature of the room in which the stirrer 
is and the hardness of the gums, re- 
quires 24 to 48 hours. When the gums 
are entirely dissolved add to the mix- 
ture a solution of 21 \ parts, by weight, 
of Venice oil turpentine in 0.025 parts, 
by weight, of denaturized spirit of 95 per 
cent, allowing the stirrer to run another? 
to 3 hours. For the purpose of removing 
any impurities present or any undis- 
solved rosin from the varnish, il is poured 
through a hair sieve or through a three- 
fold layer of fine muslin (organdie) into 
suitable tin vessels or zinc-lmed barrels 
for further clarification. After 10 to l* 
days the varnish is ready for use. ny 
grinding this varnish with the corre- 
sponding dry pigments .the daawd 
shades of color may be obtained; brt* 
is well to remark that chemically pur _ 
zinc white cannot be used With aav 
tage because it thickens and lose,

French Varnish. — So-called French 
varnish is made by dissolving 1 part of 
bleached or orange shellac in 5 parts of 
alcohol, the solution being allowed to 
stand and the clear portion then being de- 
canted. The varnish may be colored by 
materials which are soluble in alcohol. 

For red, use 1 part of eosin to 49 parts 
of the bleached shellac solution. For 
blue, use 1 part of aniline blue to 24 
parts of the bleached, shellac solution, as 
the orange shellac solution would impart 
a greenish cast. For green, use 1 part of 
aniline green (brilliant green) to 49 parts 
of the orange shellac solution. For yel- 
low, use cither 2 parts of extract of tur- 
meric or 1 part of gamboge to 24 parts of 
the solution, or 1 part of aniline yellow 
to 49 parts of the solution. For golden 
yellow, use 2 parts of gamboge and 1 
part of dragon's blood to 47 parts of the 
orange shellac solution. The gamboge 
and dragon's blood should be dissolved 
nrst m a little alcohol. 

Golden Varnishes. —

India -Rubber Varnishes.^L— Di SSo u 
10 pounds of India rubber in a mix 
ture of 10 pounds of turpentine and 20 
pounds of petroleum by treating S am e 
on a water bath. When the solution i 3 
completed add 45 pounds of drying oil 
and 5 pounds of lampblack and mis 
thoroughly. 

II. — Dissolve 7 pounds of India rub- 
ber in 25 pounds of oil of turpentine. By 
continued heating dissolve 14 pounds of 
rosin in the mixture. Color while hot 
with 3 pounds of lampblack. 

Inlay Varnish. — 

Ozokerite 17 parts

Melt the ozokerite and Carnauba wax, 
then stir in the turpentine oil. This 
varnish is applied like a polish and im- 
parts to the wood a dark natural color 
and a dull luster. 

Japanning Tin. — The first thing to be 
done when a vessel is to be japanned, is 
to free it from ail grease and oil, by rub- 
bing it with turpentine. Should the oil, 
however, be linseed, it may be allowed to 
remain on the vessel, which must in mat 
case be put in an oven and heated tin 
the oil becomes quite hard. . 

After these preliminaries, a paint oi

II —The varnished labels of stock ves- 
sels often suffer damage from the spilling 
of the contents and the dripping alter 
much pouring. . 

Formalin gelatin is capable of with- 
standing the baneful influence of ether, 
benzine, water, spirit of wine, oil, and 
most substances. The following method 
of applying the preservative is recom- 
mended: Having thoroughly cleaned 
the surface of the vessel, paste the label 
on and allow it to dry well. Give it a 
coat of thin collodion to protect the 
letters from being dissolved out or caused 
to run, then after a few minutes paint 
over it a coat of gelatin warmed to 
fluidity— 5 to 25 — being careful to cover 
m all the edges. Just before it solidifies 
go over it with a tuft of cotton dipped 
mto a 40 per cent formalin solution. It 
soon dries and becomes as glossy as 
varnish, and may be coated again and 
again without danger of impairing the 
clear white of the label or decreasing its 
transparency. 

father Varnishes. — I. — An excellent 
varnish for leather can be made from the 
louowing recipe: Heat 400 pounds of 
foiled oil to 212° F., and add little by 
Pounds of bichromate of potash, 
^ e Ping the same temperature. The 
Xw° n 0f the bichromate should take

&/ at V/e, 40 pounds Prussian blue. 
tG4ftoo°I 3 „ nou rs more, gradually raising 
^ to 572° p., w i t h constant stirring. 



In the meantime, heat together at 392° 
F., for £ an hour, 25 pounds linseed oil. 
35 pounds copal, 75 pounds turpentine, 
and 7 pounds ceresmc. Mix the two 
varnishes, and dilute, if necessary, when 
cold with turpentine. The varnish should 
require to be warmed for easy application 
with the brush. 

II- — Caoutchouc, 1 part; petroleum, 
1 part; carbon bisulphide, 1 part; 
shellac, 4 parts; bone black, 2 parts; 
alcohol, 20 parts. First the caoutchouc 
is brought together with carbon bisul- 
phide in a well-closed bottle and stood 
aside for a few days. As soon as the 
caoutchouc is soaked add the petroleum 
and the alcohol, then the finely powdered 
shellac, and heat to about 125° F. When 
the liquid appears pretty clear, which 
indicates the solution of all substances, 
the bone black is added by shaking 
thoroughly and the varnish is at once 
filled in bottles which are well closed. 
This pouch composition excels in drying 
quickly and produces upon the leather a 
smooth, deep black coating, which pos- 
sesses a certain elasticity.

Bronze Varnishes. — I. The follow- 
ing process yields a top varnish for 
bronze goods and other metallic ware m 
the mosf varying shades, the varnish ex- 
celling, besides, in high gloss and dur- 
Ibility. Fill in a bottle, pale shellac, 
best quality, 40 parts, by weight; pow- 
dered Florentine lake, 12 parts, by 
weight; gamboge, 30 parts, by weight; 
dragon's blood, also powdered, 6 parts, 
by weight; and add 400 parts, by weight, 
of spirit of wine. This mixture is al- 
lowed to dissolve, the best way being to 
heat the bottle on the water bath until the 
boiling point of water is almost reached, 
shaking from time to time until all is 
dissolved. Upon cooling, decant the 
liquid, which constitutes a varnish of 
dark-red color, from any sediment that 
may be present. In a second bottle dis- 
solve in the same manner 24 parts, by 
weight, of gamboge in 400 parts, by 
weight, of spirit of wine, from which will 
result a varnish of golden-yellow tint. 
According to the hue desired, mix the 
red varnish with the yellow variety, pro- 
ducing in this way any shade from the 
deepest red to the color of gold. If re- 
quired, dilute with spirit of wine. The 
application of the varnish should be con- 
ducted as usual, that is, the article should 
be slightly warm, it being necessary to 
adhere strictly to a certain temperature, 
which can be easily determined by trials 
and maintained by experience. In order 
to give this varnish a pale-yellow to 
greenish-yellow tone, mix 10 drops of 
picric acid with about 3 parts, by weight, 
of spirit of wine, and add to a small 
quantity of the varnish some of this mix- 
ture until the desired shade has been 
reached. _ Picric acid ia poisonous, and 
tbe keeping of varnish mixed with this 
acid in a closed bottle is not advisable, 
because there is danger of an explosion. 
Iherefore, it is best to 



prepare only so

is made by dissolving 20 ounces 0 f 
kino and 5 ounces of gum benjamin & S 
ounces of the best cold alcohol-, 20 oun 
of common shellac and 2 ounces ot thn! 
turpentine in 36 ounces of alcohol »1 
give a very good varnish. If t h e brow!

ounces of ruby shellac, 5 ounces bals ai ! 
of copaiba, and 2 to 5 ounces of anilro- 
brown, with or without 4 to 1 ounce of 
aniline violet, in 150 ounces of alcohol. 

Copper Varnishes. -

other flask on the bath SO ounces of 
gamboge in 500 ounces of the same spirit. 
The two liquids are mixed until the right 
color needed for the particular purpose 
in hand is obtained. Dilute with spirit 
if too thick. The addition of a little 
picric acid gives a greenish-yellow bronze 
but makes the varnish very liable to ex- 
plode. .These varnishes are applied to 
gently warmed surfaces with a soft 
bristle brush. 



Gold Varnish for Tin.— This is obtained 
in the following manner: Spread out 5 
parts, by weight, of finely powdered 
crystallized copper acetate in a warm 
spot, allowing it to lie for some time; then 
grind the powder, which will have, ac- 
quired a light-brown shade, with oil of 
turpentine and add, with stirring, 15 
Parts, by weight, of fat copal varnish 
heated to 140° F. When the copper 
acetate has dissolved (in about i hour), 
me mass is filled in a bottle and allowed 
to stand warm, for several days, shaking 
frequently. The gold varnish is then 
ready for use. Coat the articles uni-

MODERN VARNISH MAKING. 

Like most commodities there is a great 
difference in the composition of present 
day varnishes as compared with those of 
several years back. While linseed oil ia 
still used in making various types of 
varnishes it has been superseded mostly 
by the now well known China Wood Oil 
or often known as Tung Oil. It could 
be stated without exaggeration that at 
least 80% of the varnish made consists 
mostly of China Wood Od as the type of 
oil used. 

Likewise a great change has taken 
place in the solid materials used for dur- 
ing the past the gums and resins used 
chiefly were those natural gums such as 
Copals, Manillas, Damars, Elemis, etc., 
while the cheaper varnishes today use as 
the base Rosin Ester, a resin produced 
by nature but chemically treated so that 
it is called an artificial resin. Most cheap 
varnishes and a few medium grade are 
made with the use of this gum as the 
solid material and in a few instances 
other natural gums are incorporated 
with this gum to produce varnishes giv- 
ing various Tesults. 

The greatest improvement perhaps 
found in the varnishes that _ are mac 
using a synthetic resin of the Amberol 
type as the solid content. Amb"d»

tne&c resin to make , It ^f^i

Sin Soles laid down are followed. The 
SSSSSten of the cooking of the resins, 
heating of oils, etc., still remains some- 
thing of an art and therefore experience 
and continual experimentation is of un- 
oftimated value. - 

There is always danger of a fire since 
the fumes arc highly inflammable and it 
is always customary for the varnish maker 
to have several heavy burlap sacks which 
are wet, handy so he can put them over 
the flame and smother a fire Carbon 
Tetachloride in hermetically sealed bulbs 
is now obtainable from dealers and these 
can be thrown at the fire also. Do not 
try to put out a varnish fire with a soda 
and acid extinguisher or with water for 
they will both spread the flames. 

NOTES ON VARNISH MAKING. 

Batches of varnish are usually pre- 
pared taking one hundred pounds of 
g iim or resin as the solid material and 
from twenty to fifty gallons of oil as the 
cooking medium. In other words it is 
hardly profitable or worth while to go 
to the expense and bother of cooking 
Tarnish in less quantities than this. 

Copper kettles are usually used and 
will last for a long time if properly used. 

It is the custom among the large 
vamish makers to make up three or four 
Standard varnishes out of the natural 
gums such as Manilla, Kauri, Damars, 
etc., and by intermixing these various 
types can produce almost an endless 
variety of finishing varnishes. For in- 
stance it is known that the varnishes 
made from the use of Kauri Gum will 
produce tough films and out of these 
are made our Spar Varnishes. Manilla 
gums produce softer and more brittle 
varnishes and by a system of mixing 
certain proportions together a varnish of

and expert varnish maker knows exact! 
how hot to have his fire, how ] c - - 



cook the varnish, how rapidly he ° 
reach the top heats, etc., and it is the 
important things that will make or hSr 
the varnish. To the beginner we ttousS 
he make up very small batches at first 
and carefully time his cooking, taking 
temperatures with a thermometer very 
often and keep close watch of everything 
he does so that he can repeat the job 
if the varnish proves to be a good one 
This must be emphasized so that the hi 
experienced one will not be disappointed 
at his results. 

There are of course many formulas for 
making many kinds of varnishes. Often- 
times, however, the same formula is used 
in producing a varnish that is sold under 
a variety of names and for a variety of 
purposes. Some varnish manufacturers 
who may not be over scrupulous ■will 
make a varnish using 150 pounds of 
Rosin Ester Gum to 400 pounds of China 
Wood Oil, cook it, add the thinners and 
driers and label it as Floor Varnish, In- 
terior Varnish, Spar Varnish and what 
not. And of course the buying public 
seldom knows the difference. It is need- 
less to Say that there is a great difference.

Melt resin thoroughly in linseed oil. 
Temperature will run around 500 de- 
grees F. although a certain temperature 
is not the desirable point. With the 
stirring rod one can feel when the resin 
is all melted. This usually requires from 
% of an hour to IV2 hours depending 
upon the kind of oil, quality and amount 
of both oil and gums. After the resin 
has been cooked and is melted thor- 
oughljr in the oil it is cooled down to 
admit the reduction with turpentine and 
thinner, also to add the drier. 

Spar Varnish —No doubt but the most 
common and best spar varnishes are to- 
a &y made from the synthetic resins such 
as A-mberol which is used in other for- 
mulas. The following formula will give 
n idea to work from, the combination

to 5G5 degrees F. and it is held there f 01 
string on glass to nine or ten inches. 
The Lead Resinate and Linseed Oil are 
then added. The mixture is then cooled 
to about 450 degrees F. when the thin- 
ners and driers are added. 

Experimentation with different kinds 
of resins and gums mixed with different 
proportions of linseed and china wood 
oil must be made to determine the re- 
sults desired as only practice will enable 
one to produce the material required. 
Let it be remembered that Varnish 
Cooking is an art, not simply a mix- 
ing and heating process. It is impor- 
tant to know that varnishes made with 
natural gums as the solid content and 
cooked with different proportions of oils 
and thinners can be mixed together after 
they are made, to obtain different kinds 
of finished varnishes. As an example? 
Oftentimes a copal varnish will be mixed 
together with a Kauri Varnish to pro- 
duce a varnish having certain working 
qualities which a painter or manufac- 
turer desires. For this reason many 
manufacturers make only three or four 
varnishes in the kettles and by inter- 
mixing these obtain various kinds of 
products, suitable for a variety of pur- 
poses.

most certain to get the genuine article. 

Pure Shellac can be obtained in either 
White or Orange and ranges in * variety 
of cuts from 3 pounds to a gallon of al- 
cohol to 5 pounds in a gallon. Factories 
usually purchase it four pounds to a gal- 
lon and perhaps most cutters use this 
amount as standard. For many pur- 
poses in architectural work or for finish- 
ing hard wood floors, Pure Shellac has 
never been equalled. 

There are many products on the mar- 
ket sold as "Shellac Substitutes" and 
gome have quite a wide sale for cheap 
work, where the cost of using Pure Shel- 
lac is not allowed but no substitute has 
yet ever measured up to the quality and 
working conditions of the genuine article. 
Loud claims are made for various prod- 
ucts some being copals in solution, Ester 
Gums and various synthetic resins and 
are often offered at around one half the 
price of the Pure Shellac. For an under- 
coat under a varnish surface it knows 
no equal and is still widely used in this 
respect.
