Flowers of sulphur are recognized 
readily from the odor of sulphurous acid 
during combustion on red-hot iron. 

Tallow may be detected by the taste 
and odor. Pure wax has an aromatic, 
agreeable taste, while that mixed with 
tallow is repulsive both in taste and 
smell. Pure wax, worked between the 
fingers, grows soft, preserving a certain 
cohesion in all parts. It divides into 
lumps, which adhere to the fingers, if it 
is mixed with tallow. The adulteration 
may also be detected by the thick and 
nauseating fumes produced when it is 
burned on heated iron. 

Stearic acid may be recognized by 
means of boiling alcohol, which dissolves 
it in nearly all proportions and causes it 
to deposit crystals on cooling, while it is 
without action on the wax. Blue litmus 
paper, immersed in alcohol solution, 
reddens on drying in air, and thus serves 
for detecting the presence of stearic acid. 

Ocher is found by treating the wax 
with boiling water. A lemon-yellow 
deposit results, which, taken up with 
chlorhydric acid, yields with ammonia a 
lemon-yellow precipitate of ferric oxide. 

The powder of burnt bones separates 
and forms a residue, when the wax is 
heated with oil of turpentine. 

Artificial Beeswax.— This is obtained 
oy mixing the following substances, in ap- 
proximately the proportions stated: Paraf- 
biie, 45 parts, by weight; white Japan 
veeetable wax, 30 parts, by weight; rosins. 



or colophonies, 10 parts, by weight; white 
pitch, 10 parts, by weight; tallow, 5 pajU 
by weight; ceresine, colorant, 0.030 parts 
by weight; wax perfume, 0.100 parts, by 
weight. If desired, the paraffine may b e 
replaced with ozokerite, or by a mixture 
of vaseline and ozokerite, for the purpose 
of varying the fusing temperature, or 
rendering it more advantageous for the 
various applications designed. The fol- 
lowing is the method of preparation: 
Melt on the boiling water bath, shaking 
constantly, the paraffine, the Japan wax, 
the rosins, the pitch, and the tallow. 
When the fusion is complete, add the 
colorant and the perfume. When these 
products are perfectly mingled, remove 
from the fire, allow the mixture to cool, 
and run it into suitable molds. The wax 
thus obtained may be employed specially 
for encaustics for furniture and floors, or 
for purposes where varnish is employed.

Melt the articles together over a gentle 
fire, and when completely melted and 
homogeneous, pour into a sizable earthen- 
ware vessel, and stir in, while still warm, 
o parts of the best French turpentine. 
Cool for 24 hours, by which time the 
mass has acquired the consistence of sort, 
butter, and is ready for use. Its method 
of use is very simple. It is smeared J 
small quantities, on woolen cloths, ana 
with these is rubbed into the wood. 

This is the best preparation, but one m 
which the beeswax is merely dissolved

Gilders' Wax.— For the_ production of 
various colorings of gold in fire gilding, 
the respective places are rr~quently 
covered with so-called gilders' wax. 
These consist of mixtures of various 
chemicals which have an etching action 
in the red heat upon the bronze mass, 
thus causing roughness of unequal depth, 
as -well as through the fact that the com- 
position of the bronze is changed some- 
what on the surface, a relief of the gold 
color being effected in consequence of 
[ these two circumstances. The gilding 
wax is prepared by melting together th 
auely powdered chemicals with wax ac- 
cording to the following recipes:

coarsely ground. 

II. — Excessive use of filling agents. ^ 
HI —Insufficient binding of the pig- 
ments and fillings with a suitable ad- 
hesive agent, which causes these bodies 
to absorb the adhesive power of the 
gums. 

IV, — Excessive heating of the mass, 
caused by improper melting or faulty 
admixture of the gummy bodies. Tur- 
pentine and rosin must be heated before 
entering the shellac. If this rule is in- 
verted, as is often the case, the shellac 
sticks to the bottom and burns partly. 

Great care must be taken to mix the 
coloring matter to a paste with spirit or 
oil of turpentine before adding to the 
other ingredients. Unless this is done 
the wax will not be of a regular tint. 

Dark Blue Wax. — Three ounces Vene- 
tian turpentine, 4 ounces shellac, 1 ounce 
rosin, 1 ounce Prussian blue, J ounce 
magnesia. 

Green "Wax. — Two ounces Venetian 
turpentine, 4 ounces shellac, ounces

rosin, colophony, ounces Chinese red, 
1 drachm magnesia, with oil of turpen- 
tine. 

Gold Wax. — Pour ounces Venetian 
turpentine, 8 ounces shellac, 14 sheets of 
genuine leaf gold, ?, ounce bronze, J 
ounce magnesia, with oil of turpentine". 

White Wax. — I.— The wax is bleached 
exposing to moist air and to the sun, 




but it must first be prepared i n thin 
sheets or ribbons or in grams. p or thia 
purpose it is first washed, to fr^e it f rom 
the honey which may adhere, melted 
and poured into a tin vessel, whose botl 
torn is perforated with narrow silts" 
The melted wax falls in a thin stream 
on a wooden cylinder arranged bcl 0w 
and half immersed m cold water. This 
cylinder is turned, and the wax, rolW 
round in thin leaves, afterwards falls int 
to the water. To melt it in grains, a 
vessel is made use of, perforated with 
small openings.^ which can be rotated. 
The wax is projected in graina into the 
cold water. It is spread on frames of 
muslini, moistened with water several 
times a day, and exposed to the sun until 
the wax assumes a fine white. Thia 
whiteness, however, is not perfect. The 
operation of melting and separating into 
ribbons or grains must be renewed. 
Finally, it is melted and flowed into 
molds. The duration of the bleaching 
may be abridged by adding to the wax, 
treated as above, from 1.25 to 1,75 per 
cent of rectified oil of turpentine, free 
from rosin. In 6 or 8 days a result will 
be secured which would otherwise re- 
quire 5 or 6 weeks.

Whitewash 

(See also Paint.) 

Wash the ceiling by wetting it twice 
with water, laying on as much as can 
well be floated on, then rub the old 
color up with a stumpy brush and wipe 
ott with a large sponge. Stop all cracks 
with whiting and plaster of Paris. When 
dry, clancole with size and a little of the 
whitewash when this is dry. If very 
much stained, paint those parts with 
turps, color, and, if necessary, claricole 
again. To make the whitewash, take a 
dozen pounds of whiting (in large balls), 
break them up in a pa.il, and cover with 
water to soak. During this time melt 
over a slow fire 4 pounds common size, 
and at the same time, with a palette 
knife or small trowel, rub up fine albout a 
dessertspoonful of blue-black with water 
tb a fine paste; then pour the water off 
the top of the whiting and with a stick 
stir in the black; when well mixed, stir in 
the melted size and strain. _ When cold, 
it is fit for use. If the jelly is too stiff for 
use, beat it up well and add a little cold 
water. Commence whitewashing over 
the window and so work from the light. 
Distemper color of any tint^ may be 
made by using any other color instead of 
the blue-black — as ocher, chrome, Dutch 
pink, raw sienna for yellows and buff; 
Venetian red, burnt sienna, Indian red or 
purple brown for reds; celestial blue, 
ultramarine, indigo for blues; red and 
blue for purple, gray or lavender; red 
lead and chrome for orange; Brunswick 
green for greens. . .,

WHITEWASH, TO REMOVE: 

See Cleaning Preparations and Meth- 
ods. 

WHITE METAL: 

See Alloys. 

WINDOW -CLEANING COMPOUND: 
See Cleaning Compounds. 

WINDOW DISPLAY: 

See also Sponges. 

An attractive window display for 
stores can be prepared as follows: 

In a wide-mouth jar put some sand, 
say, about 6 inches in depth. ^ Make a 
mixture of equal parts of aluminum sul- 
phate, copper sulphate, and iron sul- 
phate, coarsely powdered, and strew it 
over the surface of the sand. Over this 
layer gently pour a solution of sodium 
silicate, dissolved in 3 parts of hot water, 
taking care not to disturb the layer of 
sulphates. In about a week or 10 days 
the surface will be covered with crystals 
of different colors, being silicates of 
different metals employed. Now take 
some pure water and let it run into the 
vessel by a small tube, using a little more 
of it than yon used of the water-glass 
solution. This will displace the water- 
glass solution, and a fresh crop of crystals 
will come in the silicates, and makes, 
when properly done, a pretty scene. 
Take care in pouring in the water to let 
the point of the tube be so arranged as 
not to disturb the crop of silicates. 

WINDOW PERFUME. 

In Paris an apparatus has been intro- 
duced consisting of a small tube which 
I? att * Cne d !en gthwise on the exterior of 
the shop windows. Through numerous 
little holes a warm, lightly perfumed 
current of air is passed, which pleasantly 
tickles the olfactory nerves of the looker- 
oa and at the same time keeps the panes 



clear and clean, so that the goads exhib- ' 
ited present the best possible appearance. 

WINE BRICKS: 

Simply press dry grapes into a brick 
with enough grape sugar or glucose 
added to hold it together. The drying i s 
not carried as far as is the case with 
raisins or prunes. Raisins or prunes 
would do as well for the purpose.

BITTERS. 

Bitters,_ as the 
merely tinctures 

barks, with the addition of spices to 
flavor, and depend for their effect upon 
their tonic action on the stomach. Taken 
too frequently, however, they may do 
harm, by ovcrstimulatmg the digestive 
organs. 

The recipes for some of these pre para- 
tions run to great lengths, one for An- 
gostura bitters containing no fewer than 
28 ingredients. A very good article, how- 
ever, maybe made without all this elabo< 
ration. The following, for instance, make 
a very good preparation: 

Gentian root (sliced).. 12 ounces 

Cinnamon bark 10 ounces 

Caraway seeds 10 ounces 

Juniper berries 2 ounces

CORDIALS. 

Tordials, according to the Spatula 
flavored liquors containing from 40 
f^O D er cent of alcohol (from 52 to 64 
LdoK to each gallon) and from 20 
fo ffper cent of sugar (from 25 to 32 
Innces avoirdupois to each gallon). 

Cordials, while used in this country to 
some degree, have their greatest con- 
sumption in foreign lands, especially m 
France and Germany. 

Usually such mixtures as these are 
clarified or "fined" only with consider- 
able difficulty, as the finally divided 
particles of oil pass easily through the 
pores of the filter paper. Purified talcum 
will be found to be an excellent clarifying 
medium; it should be agitated with the 
liquid and the liquid then passed through 
a thoroughly wetted filter. The filtrate 
should be returned again and again to 
the filter until it filters perfectly bright. 
Purified talcum being chemically inert is 
superior to magnesium carbonate and 
other substances which are recom- 
mended for this purpose. 

When the filtering process is com- 
pleted the liquids should at once be put 
into suitable bottles which should be 
filled and tightly corked and sealed. 
Wrap the bottles in paper and store 
away, laying the bottles on their sides in 
a moderately warm place. A shelf near 
toe ceiling is a good place. Warmth and 
age improve the beverages, as it appears 
J? f °J' e perfectly blend the flavors, so 
mat the older the liquor becomes the 
fetter it is. These liquids must never

DETANNATING WINE. 

According to Caspari, the presence of 
appreciab e quantities of tannin £ Twine 
s decidedly objectionable if the winds to 
oe used m connection with iron and 
other metallic salts; moreover, tannin is 
incompatible with alkaloids, and hence 
wine not deprived of its tannin should 
never be used as a menstruum for alka- 
loidal drugs. The process of freeing 
wines from tannin is termed detannation, 
and is a very simple operation. The 
easiest plan is to add £ ounce of gelatin 
m number 40 or number 60 powder 
to 1 gallon of the wine, to agitate oc- 
casionally during 24 or 48 hours, and 
then to filter. The operation is prefer- 
ably carried out during cold weather or 
in a cold apartment, as heat will cause 
the gelatin to dissolve, and the macera- 
tion must be continued until a small 
portion of the wine mixed with a few 
drops of ferric chloride solution shows 
no darkening of color. Gelatin in large 
pieces is not suitable, especially with 
wines containing much tannin, since the 
newly formed tanna*e of gelatin will be 
deposited on the surface and prevent 
further intimate contact of the gelatin 
with the wine. Formerly freshly pre- 
pared ferric hydroxide was much em- 
ployed for detannating wine, but the chief 
objection to its use was due to the fact 
that some iron invariably was taken up by 
the acid present in the wine; moreover, 
the process was more tedious than in the 
case of gelatin. As the removal of 
tannin from wine in no way interferes 
with its quality— alcoholic strength and 
aroma remaining the same, and only 
coloring matter being lost-a supply of 
StannLd wine should be kept on band 
for it requires very little more labor to

Sing yeasts, exist in the ;<R™« ^ 
the resting states, the latter being mucn 
Sore resistant than the former One 
Zraeteristic of the fungi and their 
spores is their great resistance to heat 
when dry. In this state they can be 
heated to 212° F. without being killed. 
The spores of the common mold are even 
more resistant. This should be well con- 
sidered in sterilizing bottles and corks, 
which should be steamed to 240° F. for 
at least 15 miuutes. t 

Practical tests so far made indicate 
that grape juice can be safely sterilized 
at from 165° to 176° F. At this tem- 
perature the flavor is hardly changed, 
while at a temperature much above 
200° P. it is. This is an important point, 
as the flavor and quality of the product 
depend on it. 

Use only clean, sound, well-ripened, 
but not over-ripe grapes. If an ordinary 
cider mill is at hand, it may be used for 
crushing and pressing, or the grapes 
may he crushed and pressed with the 
hands. If a light-colored juice is desired, 
put the crushed grapes in a cleanly 
washed cloth sack and tie up. Then 
either hang up securely and twist it or 
let two persons take hold, one on each 
end of the sack and twist until the great- 
er part of the juice is expressed. Next 
gradually heat the juice in a double 
boiler or a large stone jar in a pan of hot 
water, so that the juice does not come in 
direct contact with the fire at a tempera-

After this fill into clean bottles, 
fill entirely, but leave room for the li Qu ; f1 
to expand when again heated, pit 
thin board over the bottom of an ordinal 
wash boiler, set the filled bottles ( or dY 
nary glass fruit jars are just as good) C 
it, fill in with water around the bottles to 
within about an inch of the tops, and 
gradually heat until it is about to simmer 
Then take the bottles out and cork or ' 
seal immediately. It is a good idea to 
take the further precaution of sealing the 
corks over with sealing wax or parafflne 
to prevent mold germs from entering 
through the corks. _ Should it be de- 
sired to make red juice, heat the crushed 
grapes to not above 200° F., strain 
through a clean cloth or drip bag (no 
pressure should be used), set away to 
cool and settle, and proceed the same as 
' with light-colored juice. Many people 
do not even go to the trouble of letting 
the juice settle after^ straining it, but re- 
heat and seal it up immediately, simply 
setting the vessel away in a cool place in 
an upright position where they will be 
undisturbed. The juice is thus allowed 
to settle, and when wanted for use the 
clear juice is simply taken off the sedi- 
ment. Any person familiar with the 
process of canning fruit can also preserve 
grape juice, for the principles involved 
are identical. , 
One of the leading defects so far found 
in unfermented juice is that much of it is 
not clear, a condition which very much 
detracts from its otherwise attractive ap- 
pearance, and due to two causes already 
alluded to. Either the final sterilization 
in bottles has been at a higher tempera- 
ture than the preceding one, or the juica 
has not been properly filtered or has not 
been filtered at all. In other cases Ug 
juice has been sterilized at such a nig 
temperature that it has a disagree*^ 
scorched taste. It should be remember** 
that attempts to sterilize at a temp 
ture above 195° F. are dangerous i sc i 
as the flavor of the finished product 
concerned. . »; in eS 

Another serious mistake is s^e" ^ 
made by putting the juice into botu« d

before it is used after the bottles

process as before, after which fill the 
barrel completely with grape juice and 
roll. The barrel should then be bunged 
tightly and stored in a cool place with 
the bung, up, and so secured that the 
package cannot be shaken. In the 
course of a few weeks the juice will have 
become clear and can then be racked off 
and filled into bottles or jars direct, 
sterilized, and corked or sealed up ready 
for use. By this method, however, unless 
skillfully handled, the juice is apt to 
have a slight taste of the sulphur.

Small quantities of grape juice may be 
preserved m bottles. Fruit is likely to 
be dusty and to be soiled in other ways, 
and grapes like other fruits, should be 
well washed before using. Leaves or 
other extraneous matter should also be 
removed. The juice is obtained by 
moderate pressure in an ordinary screw 
press, and strained through felt. By 
gently heating, the albuminous matter is 
coagulated and may be skimmed off, and 
further clarification may be effected by 
faltering through paper, but such filtra- 
tion must be done as rapidly aa possible, 
using a number of filters and excluding 
Jie air as much as possible. 

The juice so obtained may be pre- 
served by sterilization, in the following 
manner: Put the juice in the bottles in 
which it is to be kept, filling them very 
nearly full; place the bottles, unstop- 
pered, in a kettle filled with cold water, 
so arranging them on a wooden per- 
forated "false bottom" or other like con- 
trivance as to prevent their immediate 
contact with the metal, this preventing 
unequal heating and possible fracture. 
Now heat the water, gradually raising 
the temperature to the boiling point and 
maintain at that until the juice attains a 
boiling temperature; then close the 
bottles with perfectly fitting corks, which 
have been kept immersed in boding 
water for a short time before use. , 

The corks should not be fastened m 
any way, for, if the sterilization is not 
complete, fermentation and consequent 
explosion of the bottle may occur unless 
the cork should be forced out.

The wine to be impregnated with the 
acid is taken from a cask through a 
fecial tube, which also , prod uces a Tight 
pressure of carbonic acid on the cm h the 
obiect of which is to prevent the access 
^atmospheric air to the wine within 
and, besides, to cause the liquid to pass 
into the bottle without jar or stroke 
The bottles stand under the distributing 
valves, or levers, placed above and below 
them. Now, if the cock, by means of 
which the glass bulbs and the bottles 
are brought into connection, is slightly 
opened, and the desired lever is put in 
fiction, the carbonic acid at once forces 
the air out of the bottles, and sterilizes 
them. The upper bottles are now gradu- 
ally filled. The whole apparatus, in- 
cluding the filled bottles, is now tilted 
over, and the wine, of its own weight, 
flows through collectors filled with car- 
bonic acid, and passes, impregnated with 
the gas, into other bottles placed below. 
Each bottle is filled in course, the time 
required for each being some 45 seconds. 
The saturation of the liquid with car- 
bonic acid is so complete and plentiful 
that there is no need of hurry in corking. 

By means of this apparatus any desired 
still wine is at once converted into a 
sparkling one, preserving at the same 
time its own peculiarities of taste, bou- 
quet, etc. The apparatus may be used 
equally well upon fruit juices, milk, and, 
in fact, any kind of liquid, its extreme 
simplicity permitting of easy and rapid 
cleansing.

LIQUEURS. 

Many are familiar with the properties - 
liqueurs but believe them to be very com- 
plex and even mysterious compounds. 
This is, of course, due to the fact that 
the formulas are of foreign origin and 
many of them have been kept more or 
less secret for some time. Owing to ttie 
peculiar combination of the bouquet oils 
and flavors, it is impossible to make ac- 
curate analyses of them. But by the use. 
of formulas now given, these products 
seem to be very nearly duplicated. 

It is necessary to use the best sugar 
and oils obtainable in the preparation <» 
the liqueurs. As there are so many 
grades of essential oils on the market, 
it is difficult to obtain the best indirect^- 
The value of the cordials is enhanced m 
the richness and odor and flavor oi 
oils, so only the best qualities should w 
used. , Li e

May Bowl or May Wine.— The prin- 
cipal ingredient of May bowl, or that 
which gives it its flavor and bouquet is 
fresh W aldmeisterkraut (Asperula odor- 
ata), the "woodruff" or "sweet grass, 
"star grass," and a dozen other aliases, 
of a plant growing wild all over Europe, 
both continental and insular, and cul- 
tivated by some gardeners in this country. 
It is accredited with being a diuretic, 
deobstruent and hepatic stimulant, of 
no mean order, though it has long been 
banished from the pharmacopoeia. 

In Baden and in Bavaria in preparing 
Maitranlc the practice was formerly to 
first make an essence — Maiirankessenz, 
for the preparation of which every house- 
wife had a formula of her own. The 
following was that generally used in the 
south of Germany; 

I. — Fresh, budding 

woodruff, cut fine 500 parts 
Alcohol, commer- 
cial (90 per cent). 1,000 parts 
Digest together for 14 days, then filter 
and press off. Many add to this some 
flavoring oil. As coumarin has been 
found to be the principle to which the 
Waldmeister owes its odor, many add to 
the above Tonka bean, chopped fine, 1 
part to the thousand. From about 12 to 
15 drachms of this essence is added to 
make a gallon of the wine, which has 
about the following formula: 

French brandy, say 4 drachms 
Oil of unripe 

oranges 80 drops

ShE* £ d Wlt , h as llttle P^ure as pos-

sufficiently wide to receive the stems 
without pressing or bruising them and 
let the pieces fall into it. Pour £ 
sufficient strong alcohol (9G per cetU > .** 
cover the herbs completely. I n f rom 3 ~ 
to 40 minutes the entire aroma is taken 
up by the alcohol, which takes on 
beautiful green color, which, unfor- 
tunately, does not last, disappearing in a 
few days, but without affecting the aroma 
in the least. The alcohol should now be 
poured off, for if left to macerate longer 
while it would gain in aroma, it will also 
take up a certain bitter principle that 
detracts from the delicacy of flavor and 
aroma. The extract is now poured on a 
fresh quantity of the herb, and continue 
proceeding in this manner until a suffi- 
ciently concentrated extract is obtained 
tc give aroma to 100 times its weight of 
wine or cider. 

III.- — Fresh woodruff, in bloom or flower, 
is freed from the lower part of its stem 
and leaves, and also of all foreign or 
inert matter. The herb is then hghtly 
stuck into a wide-mouth bottle, and 
covered with strong alcohol. After 30 
minutes pour off the liquor on fresh 
woodruff. In another half hour the 
essence is ready, though it should not be 
used immediately. It should be kept at 
cellar heat (about 60° F.) for a few days, 
or until the green color vanishes. Any

DECORATIVE WOOD -FINISH. 

Paint or stencil wood with white-lime 
paint. When it has dried slowly in the 
shade, brush it off and a handsome dark- 
brown tone will be imparted to the oak- 
wood. Some portions which may be 
desired darker and redder are stained 
again with lime, whereby these places 
become deeper. It is essential that the 
lime be applied in even thickness and 
dried slowly, for only then the staining 
will be red and uniform. 

After the staining saturate the wood 
with a mixture of varnish, 2 parts; oil of 
turpentine, 1 part; turpentine, J part. 
When the oil ground is dry apply 2 
coatings of pale amber varnish. 

Colored decorations on pinewood can 
be produced as follows: 

The most difficult part of the work is 
to remove the rosin accumulations with- 
out causing a spot to appear. Burn out 
the places carefully with a red-hot iron, 
v^reat care is necessary to prevent the 
iron from setting the rosin on fire, thus 
causing black smoke clouds. 



The resulting holes are filled up -with, 
plaster to which a little light ochcr i 3 
added to imitate the shade of the wood 
as perfectly as possible. Plaster up n 0 
more than is necessary. 

Rub the wood down with very fi ne 
sandpaper, taking especial care to rub 
only with the grain of the wood, since all 
cross scratches will remain permanently 
visible. 

After this preliminary work cover the 
wood with a solution of white shellac, in 
order not to injure the handsome golden 
portions of the wood and to preserve the 
pure light tone of the wood in general. 

On this shellac ground paint and 
stencil with glazing colors, ground with 
isinglass solution. The smaller, more 
delicate portions, such as flowers and 
figures, are simply worked out in wash 
style with water colors, using the tone of 
the wood to remain as high lights, sur- 
rounding the whole with a black contour. 

After this treatment the panels and 
decorated parts are twice varnished with 
dammar varnish. The friezes and pilaster 
strips are glazed darker and set off with 
stripes; to varnish them use amber var- 
nish. 

The style just mentioned does not ex- 
clude any other. Thus, for instance, a 
very good effect is produced by decorat- 
ing the panels only with a black covering 
color or with black and transparent red 
(burnt sienna and a little carmine) after 
the fashion of boule work in rich orna- 
ments, in such a way that the natural 
wood forms the main part and yet quite 
a considerable portion of the ornament. 

Intarsia imitation is likewise well 
adapted, since the use of variegated cov- 
ering colors is in perfect keeping with 
the decoration of natural wood. How it 
should be applied, and how much of it, 
depends upon one's taste, as well as the 
purpose and kind of the object. 

It is a well-known fact that the large 
pores of oak always look rather smeary, 
according to whether the workshop is 
more or less dusty. If this is to be 
avoided, which is essential for neat worK, 
take good wheat starch, pound it nne

g et Lwn superstitions associated with 
r SS ;E r?ot the least of these is the 
^arkably absorbent nature which the 
S that has been roughstuffed and 
Soared'' is supposed to possess. By 
many this power of absorption is be- 
Heved to be equal to swallowing up, not 
only all the color applied, but at least 3 
c 0a ts of varnish, and none of these would 
think of applying a coat of color to a 
rouehstuffed surface without first giving 
it a coat of liquid filler as a sort . ot 
sacrificial oblation in recognition ot this 
absorbing propensity. Another authority 
on the subject has laid down the rule 
that ia the process of scouring, the block 
of pumice stone must always be moved 
in one direction, presumably for the 
reason that some trace of the stone is 
likely to be visible after the surface is 
finished. 

If the block of stone is scratching, per- 
haps the appearance of the finished panel 
may be less objectionable with the fur- 
rows in parallel lines than in what en- 
gravers call "cross-hatching,'' but if the 
rubbing is properly done it is not easy 
to discover what difference it could make 
whether the stone is moved in a straight 
hue or a circle. As to absorption, it can- 
not be distinguished in the finished 
Pa-nel between the surface that was 
coated with liquid filler and that to 
w «ich the color was applied directly, ex- 
cept that cracking always occurs much 
sooner in the former, and this will he 
lound to be the case with surfaces that

lead ground m oil, it makes the rubbing 
more laborious, increases the liability to 
scratching, and requires a much longer 
time to harden before the scouring can 
be done, without in any appreciable man- 
ner improving the quality of the surface 
when finished. 

< It may be remarked here that the 
dition of white lead, whether ground ii 



oil or added dry to the eoarsef pigment 
increases the labor of scouring just ir 
proportion as it is used until sufficient 
may be used to render the scouring proc- 
ess impossible; hence, it follows that 
the mixing should be governed by the 
character of the job in hand. If the job 
is of a cheap class the use of very little 
or no lead at all is advisable, and the pro- 
portion of Japan and turpentine may also 
be increased, with the result that a. fairly 
good surface may be obtained with mucl 
less labor than in the formula given. <

WOOD 



With the aid of the microscope in 
exam -ling the component parts ot wood 
fSSular tissue is observed which va 
in form according to the species and 
the Parts which are inspected. Hi 
Sllufar tissue is made up of small 
cavSes called pores or cells which are 
Ted with a widely diversified matter 
md arl covered with a hard and usually 
>rittle substance called hgnin. , 

This diversified matter consists of 
mineral salts and various organic sub- 
stances, gelatinous in their nature and held 
in solution by a viscous liquid and con- 
taining nitrogenous matter in different 
combinations, the whole being designated 
Dv the general name of albuminous sub- 
stances The older the wood the more 
iscous is the matter; while wood of 
recent growth (sapwood) contains less 
sdscous matter holding these substances 
in solution. This albumen m wood acts 
on substances like filler and varnish m 
one way or the other, good or bad. I he 
seasoning of wood does not dispose ot 
these substances. The water evaporates, 
leaving them adhering to the sides of the 
cells. The drier these substances are the 
less action they exert on the filler or what- 
ever substance is coated on the surface. 
If the filler disintegrates, it affects the 
varnish. 

All albuminous substances, be they dry 
or in liquid form, are subject, more or 
less, according to the protein they con- 
tain — which seems, or rather is, the es- 
sential principle of all albuminous matter 
-to the influence of caustic potash and 
soda. Thus, the albumen of an egg is 
exactly like that contained in the com- 
position of wood. As albumen in wood 
becomes solid by drying, it is easily dis- 
solved again, and will then be acted on 
chemically by any extraneous substance 
vith which it comes in contact. 

Some of the shellacs, substitutes for 
dhellacs, and some of the liquid fillers are 
manufactured from some of the following 
substances: Old linseed oil, old varnish, 
old and hard driers, turpentine, benzine, 
often gasoline, rosin, whiting, cornstarch 
flour, hulls, paint skins, silica, and so on. 
The list is long. To these must be 
added a large volume of potash, to bring 
it to and hold it in solution. There must 
be an excess of potash which is not com- 
bined into a chemical compound, which 
if it did, might mitigate its influence on 
the albumen of the wood, 
is potash in its pure state 
the solution it necessarily attacks the al 
bumen of the wood, causing disintegra- 
tion, which releases it from the wood, 
causing white, grayish flakes, and the 



But as there 
remaining in 



formation of a powder. This is not a con- 
elusion drawn from an inference but an 
established scientific fact resulting from 
experiments with fillers the various com- 
positions of which were known. All 
alkalies act on albumen. No one would 
knowingly varnish over a surface such 
as it would be were the white of an egg 
applied to it and then washed with an 
alkali solution; but that is just what is 
done when varnish is put over a wood 
surface filled with a filler which contains 
an alkali. 

Most of the combinations of material 
used in the painting trade are mixtures; 
that is, each part remains the same — • 
exerting the same chemical action on 
another substance, or any other sub- 
stance coming in contact with a paint 
mixture will exert the same chemical 
action on any part, or on any ingredient 
it contains, the same as if that part was 
by itself. 

We can now account for some of the 
numerous peculiarities of varnish. We 
know that any alkali when coming in con- 
tact with albumen forms a compound, 
which on drying is a white, brittle sub- 
stance easily "disintegrated. This is why 
potash, sal soda, and kindred substances 
will remove paint. The alkali attacks the 
albumen in the oil, softening it, causing 
easy removal, whereas if it were allowed 
to dry, the albumen in the oil would take 
on a grayish color quite brittle. Potash 
or other alkalies in filler not only attack 
the albumen in the wood, but also attack 
the albumen in the oil by forming a com- 
pound with it. Probably this compound 
is very slight, only forming a compound 
in part, enough, nevertheless, to start a 
destroying influence, which is demon- 
strated by the following results of experi- 
ments. The reader has, perhaps, some 
time in his career applied a rosin varnish 
over a potash filler and has been sur- 
prised by the good results, a more per- 
manent effect being obtained than in other 
instances where the best of varnish was 
used. This is accounted for by the rosw 
of the potash. Again, the reader may 
have had occasion to remove varnI ?J 
with potash and found that potash ™ ouI <J 
not touch it. This is because of its being 
a rosin varnish. Potash in filler may oe 
rendered somewhat inert, by reaSO p n .u f . 
its compounding with other parts of tn 
filler, but owing to the quantity, used "J 
some of the corninereia 1 fillers it is noj 
possible that all the alkali is renderea 
inert. Hence it will attack the alburaen 
wherever found, as all albumen is idea* 
tical in its chemical composition. 
Alkalies have but little effect on

clude that an application of alcohol 
to wood before the filler is applied is 
valuable, which is proven to be a fact by 
experiment. Wash one half of a board 
with alcohol, then apply the potash idler 
over all. Again, wash the portion of the 
board on which is the filler and apply 
a heavy bodied oil varnish. Expose to 
sunlight and air the same as a finished 
door or the like, and wait for the result. 
At the end of a few months a vast differ- 
ence will be found in the two parts of the 
surface. The one on which there is no 
alcohol will show the ravages of time and 
the elements much sooner than the one 
on which it is. 

. Wood finishers demand a difference 
in the composition of fillers, paste and 
"quid, for open- and close-grained wood, 
respectively, but unfortunately they do 
»°t demand a difference between either 
k »m in themselves, according to the kind 
°f. wood. p as te fillers are used indis- 
criminately for open -grained wood and 
quid for close-grained wood.

number now on the market), they will 
not number nearly so many in the ag- 
gregate as might be supposed; as it will 
be found m many instances that two en- 
tirely different varieties of wood resemble 
each other more closely in their vascular 
formation and cell characteristics than 
do two other specimens of the same variety. 
It is a recognized fact that paste fillers 
whose base is starch or the like work 
better and give better results in certain in- 
stances, while those whose base is mineral 
matter seem to do better in other cases. 

It is noticed that rosewood as a finish- 
ing veneer is obsolete. This is not because 
of its scarcity, but because it is so hard 
to finish without having been seasoned 
for a long time. In these days, manu- 
facturers cannot wait. It takes longer 
for the sap of rosewood to become inac- 
tive, or in trade parlance to "die," than 
any other wood. This is because it takes 
so long for the albumen in the sap to 
coagulate. Rosewood has always been a 
source of trouble to piano makers, on 
account of the action of the sap on the 
varnish. However, if this wood, previ- 
ously to filling, was washed with a weak 
solution of phosphoric acid, and then 
with wood spirit, it might be more easily 
finished. The phosphoric acid would 
coagulate the albumen on the surface of 
the wood immediately, while alcohol 
would reduce it to an insoluble state.

Hne "is "indulged in, it will not take the 
finisher very long to learn just what 
treatmen i/best for the work m hand. 
How often it has been noticed m some- 
thing of two parts, like a door, that the 
panels when finished will pit, run, or 
sa*?, while the sides will present a sur- 
face in every way desirable and wee 
versa. This is due to the difference m 
the ceLlular construction of the wood 
and to the cellulose, and cannot be 
otherwise for the parts have been seasoned 
the same time and treated^ exactly alike. 
The physiology of wood is imperfectly 
understood, but enough is known to 
warrant us in saying with a certainty 
that the chemicals in fillers do act upon 
the principles embodied in its formation. 

Some tried formulas follow: 
I. — Make a paste to fill the cracks as 
follows: Old furniture polish: Whiting, 
plaster of Paris, pumice stone, litharge, 
equal parts, Japan drier, boiled linseed 
oil, turpentine, coloring matter, of each a 
sufficient quantity. 

Rub the solids intimately with a mix- 
ture of 1 part of the Japan, 2 parts of the 
linseed oil, and 3 parts of turpentine, 
coloring to suit with Vandyke brown or 
sienna. Lay the filling on with a brush, 
let it set for about SO minutes, and then 
rub off clean except where it is to remain. 
In 2 days it will be hard enough to polish. 
After thesurface has been thus prepared, 
the application of a coat of first-class 
copal varnish is in order. It is recom-

If the hand-polishing method be p re 
ferred, it may be pursued by rubbina 
briskly and thoroughly with the follow, 
ing finishing polish: 

Alcohol 8 ounces 

Shellac. £ drachms 

Gum benzoin & drachma 

Best poppy oil 2 drachms 

Dissolve the shellac and gum in the 
alcohol in a warm place, with frequent 
agitation, and, when cold, add the poppy 
oil. This may be applied on the end of 
a cylindrical rubber made by tightly 
rolling a piece of flannel, which has been 
torn, not cut, into strips 4 to 6 inches 
wide. It should be borne in mind that 
the surface of the cabinet work of a 
piano is generally veneered, and this 
being so, necessitates _ the exercise of 
much skill and caution in polishing. 

II. — Prepare a paste from fine starch 
flour and a thick solution of brown 
shellac, -with the spatula upon a grinding 
stone, and rub the wooden object with 
this. After the drying, rub off with 
sandpaper and polish lightly with a rag 
moistened with a thin shellac solution 
and a few drops of oil. The ground thus 

firepared varnish once or twieeand a fine 
ustcr will be obtained. This method 
is well adapted for any wood with large 
pores, such as oak. 

Removal of Heat Stains from Polished 
Wood. — Fold a sheet of blotting paper a 
couple of times (making 4 thicknesses of 
the paper), cover the place with it, and 
put a hot smoothing iron thereon. Have 
ready at hand some bits of flannel, also 
folded and made quite hot. As soon as 
the iron has made the surface of the 
wood quite warm, remove the paper, 
etc., and go over the spot with a piece or 
parafSne, rubbing it hard enough to 
leave a coating of the substance. JNJ| 
with one of the hot pieces of flannel rtiP 
the injured surface. Continue the nuj 
bing, using freshly warmed cloths until 
the whiteness leaves the varnisii ox 
polish. The operation may have to ^ 
repeated.

It fa probable that it IS partly m con- 
JSm of this method that the teak- 
wood acquires its exceptional resistance 
to various destructive agents. 

TTT— A good preservation of P^es, 
stakes and palisades is obtained by 
Svfng the wood in a bath of cupnc 
sulphate of 4° of the ordinary acidimeter 
for a time which may vary from S to ia 
days, according to greater or less dry- 
ness of the wood and its size. Atter 
they are half dried they are immersed m 
a bath of limewater; this forms with the 
sulphate an insoluble compound, pre- 
venting the rain from dissolving the 
sulphate which has penetrated the wood. 
This process is particularly uselul for vine 
props and the wood of white poplars. 

A good way to prevent the decay ot 
stakes would be to plant them upside 
to bury the upper ex- 
ranch in the ground. In 



stakes would be to plant thern upsiae 
down; that is, to bury the upper ex- 
tremity of the branch in the ground. In 
this way, the capillary tubes do not so 
easily absorb the moisture which is the 
cause of decay. It frequently happens 
that for one or another reason, the im- 
pregnation of -woods designed to be 
Planted in the ground, such as masts, 
P os ts, and supports has been neglected.

K V s m ade in a downward slanting 
J T ectiori ; filled with earbolineum, and 
with a wooden plug. 



It depends upon the consistency of the 
wood Whether the liquid will be absorbed 
in 1 or 2 days The hole is filled again 
for a week. The earbolineum replaces 
by degrees the water contained in the 
wood. When it is well impregnated, the 
hole is definitely closed with a plug of 
wood, which is sawn level with the open- 
ing. The wood will thus be preserved 
quite as well as if it had been previously 
coated with earbolineum. 

IV. — -Wooden objects remaining in the 
open air may be effectually protected 
against the inclemency of the weather by 
means of the following coating: Finely 
powdered zinc oxide :s worked into a 
paste with water and serves for white- 
washing walls, garden fences, benches, 
and other wooden objects. After dry- 
ing, probably at the end of 2 or 3 hours, 
the objects must be whitewashed again 
with a very dilute solution of zinc 
chloride in glue or water. _ Zinc oxide 
and zinc chloride form a brilliant, solid 
compound, which resists the inclemency 
of the weather. 

As a paint for boards, planks for cover- 
ing greenhouses, garden-frames, etc.. 
Inspector Lucas, of Reutlingen ( Wiirtem- 
bere), has recommended the following 
coating: Take fresh cement of. the best 
quality, which has been kept m a cool 
place/work it up with milk on a stone 
until it is of the consistency of od paint. 
The wood designed to receive it must not 
be smooth, but left rough after .sawing. 
Two or 8 coats are also a protection om 
fire. Wood to be tnus treated must t 
very dry.

WOOD 



The sap is eliminated in this 
Tfaen the Receiver is filled w! & 
™Jn in solution with a hydrocarbide. 
The saturation takes place in two hours, 
when ?he liquid is allowed to run off, and 
Set of vapor is introduced, which carries 
off the soFvent, whole the rosin remains 
fn the pores of the wood, increasing its 
weight considerably, 

YH Wood can be well preserved by 

impregnating it with a solution of tannate 
oHerric protoxide. This method is due 
to Hazfeld. 

VIII — The Hasselmann process (xyl- 
olized wood), which consists in immers- 
ing the wood in a saline solution kept 
boiling under moderate pressure, the 
liquid containing copper and iron sul- 
phates (20 per cent of the hrst and SO 
per cent of the second), as well as 
aluminum and kainit, a substance until 
recently used only as a fertilizer, is now- 
much employed on the railways in Ger- 
many. 

IX. — Recently the discovery has been 
made that wood may be preserved with 
dissolved betuline, a vegetable product of 
the consistency of paste, called also 
birchwood rosin. Betuline must first be 
dissolved. It is procurable in the crude 
state at a low price. The wood is im- 
mersed for about 12 hours in the solu- 
tion, at a temperature of from 57° to 
60° P. 

After the first bath the wood is 
plunged into a second, formed of a solu- 
tion of pectic acid of 40° to 45° Be., 
and with a certain percentage of an 
alkaline carbonate — for instance, potas- 
sium carbonate of commerce — in the 
proportion of 1 part of carbonate to 
about 4 parts of the solution. The wood 
remains immersed in this composition 
for 12 hours; then it is taken out and 
drained from 8 to 15 hours, the time 
varying according to the nature of the 
wood and the temperature. In con- 
sequence of this second bath, the betulin 
which was introduced through the first 
immersion, is fixed in the interior of the 
mass. If it is desirable to make the 
wood more durable and to give it special 
qualities of density, hardness, and 
elasticity, it must be submitted to strong 
pressure In thus supplementing the 
chemical with mechanical treatment, the 
best results are obtained. 

L3*~ rA i i n ec f iv ? r of an y form or dimen- 
sions is filled with a fluid whose boiling 
point is above 21S1° F„ such as heavy tar 
oil saline solutions, etc. This is kept at 
^ T^ ate temperature varying be- 
tween 212° F. and the boiling point? the 



latter will not be reached, but if into thia 
liquid a piece of wood is plunged, an 
agitation analogous to boiling is mani- 
fested, produced by the water and sap 
contained in the pores of the wood. 
These, under the action of a temperature 
above 212° F., are dissolved into vapor 
and traverse the bath. 

If the wood is left immersed and a 
constant temperature maintained until 
every trace of agitation has disappeared, 
the water in the pores of the wood will 
be expelled, with the exception of a slight 
quantity, which, being in the form of 
vapor, represents only the seventeen- 
hundredth part of the original weight of 
the water contained; the air which was 
present in the pores having been likewise 
expelled. 

If the liquid is left to cool, this vapor is 
condensed, forming a vacuum, winch is 
immediately filled under the action of the 
atmospheric pressure. In this way the 
wood is completely saturated by the 
contents of the bath, whatever may be 
its form, proportions or condensation. 

To attain the desired effect it is not 
necessary to employ heavy oils. The 
latter have, however, the advantage of 
leaving on the surface of the prepared 
pieces a kind of varnish, which con- 
tributes to protect them against mold, 
worms, moisture, and dry rot. The 
same phenomenon of penetration is 
produced when, without letting the wood 
grow cold in the bath, it is taken out and 
plunged immediately into a cold bath of 
the same or of a different fluid. This 
point is important, because it is possible 
to employ as fluids to be absorbed 
matters having a boiling point below 
£12° F., and differing in this respect 
from the first bath, which must be com- 
posed of a liquid having a boiling point 
above 212° F. 

If, instead of a cold bath of a homo- 
geneous nature, two liquids of different 
density separated in two layers, are em- 
ployed, the wood can, with necessary 
precautions, be immersed successively 
in them, so that it can be penetrated 
with given quantities of each. Such 
liquids are heavy tar oil and a solution or 
zinc chloride of 2° to 4° Be. The hrst, 
which is denser, remains at the bottom 
of the vessel, and the second above. J 
the wood is first immersed in a salin 
solution, it penetrates deep into the pores, 
and when finally the heavy oil isabsorbea, 
the latter forms* a superficial layer, 
prevents the washing out of the saJ ', g 
solution" in the interior, as well as t 
penetration of moisture from the ° 
side.
