This work requires the use of sub- 
stances which yield their carbon readily 
and quickly to the tools on contact at 
•ugh temperature. Experience has 



shown that the best results are obtained 
by the use of yellow blood-lye salt (yel- 
low prussiate of potash), which, when 
brought in contact with the tool at a 
cherry-red heat, becomes fluid, and in 
this condition has a strong cementing 
effect. The annealing process is as fol- 
lows: The tool is heated to a cherry red 
and the blood-lye salt sprinkled over the 
surface which is to be annealed. A fine 
sieve should be used, to secure an even 
distribution of the substance. The tool 
is then put back into the fire, heated to 
the proper temperature for tempering 
and tempered. If it is desired to give " 
higher or more thorough tempering 
iron or soft steel, the annealing process 
repeated 2 or 3 times. The surface of 
the tool must, of course, be entirely free 
from scale. Small tools to which it i 
desired to impart a considerable degre 
of hardness by annealing with blood-ly* 
salt are tempered as follows: Blood-ly 
salt is melted in an iron vessel over 
moderate fire, and the tool, heated to 
brown-red heat, placed in the melte 
salt, where it is allowed to remain 
about 15 minutes. It is then heated 
the hardening temperature and hardene 
A similar but milder effect is produced 
small, thin tools by making them, r 
peatedly red hot, immersing them slowl 
in oil or grease, reheating them, an 
finally tempering them in water, lo l 
crease the effect, soot or powdered cn 
coal is added to the oil or gr ease : (tra

This mixture protects the appearance 
of polished or matted steel objects on

soap, 6 parts of chemically pure boracic 
acid, and 4 parts of phosphate of soda, 
after pulverizing, and make with water 
into a paste. For use, apply this to the 
article before the annealing. 

COLORING- STEEL: 

Black.— I. — Oil or wax may be em- 
ployed on hard steel tools; with both 
methods the tool loses more or less of its 
hardness and the blacking process there- 
fore is suited only for tools which are 
used for working wood or at least need 
not he very hard, at any rate not for 
tools which are employed for working 
steel or cast iron. The handsomest 
glossy black color is obtained by first 
polishing the tool neatly again after it 
has been hardened in water, next causing 
it to assume on a grate or a hot plate the 
necessary tempering color, yellow, vio- 
let blue, etc., then dipping it in molten, 
not too hot, yellow wax and burning off 
the adhering wax, after withdrawal, at 
a fire, without, however, further heating 
the tool. Finally dip the tool again into 
the wax and repeat the burning off at the 
flame until the shade is a nice lustrous 
black, whereupon the tool may be 
cooled off in water. The wax is sup- 
posed to impart greater toughness to the 
tool. It is advisable for all tools to have 
a trough of fat ready, which has been 
Heated to the necessary tempering de- 
gree, anc i tne tQols after j iardeninf! in

Water sufficient to make 64 p at t s 
Mix. As in all such processes a great 
deal depends upon having the article to 
be treated absolutely clean and free fro m 
grease. Unless this is the case uniform 
results are impossible. The liquid may 
be applied with a swab, or a brush, but 
if the object is small enough to dip im 0 
the liquid better results may thus be 
obtained than in any other way. The 
covering thus put on is said to be very 
lasting, and a sure protection against 
oxidation. 

Blue. — I. — Heat an iron bar to redness 
and lay it on a receptacle filled with 
water. On this bar place the objects to 
be blued, with the polished side up. As 
soon as the article has acquired the 
desired color cause it to fall quickly into 
the water. The pieces to be blued must 
always previously be polished with pum- 
ice stone or fine emery. 

II. — For screws: Take an old watch 
barrel and drill as many holes into the 
head of it as the number of screws to be 
blued. Fill it about one-fourth full of 
brass or iron filings, put in the head, 
and then fit a wire long enough to bead 
over for a handle, into the arbor holes- 
head of the barrel upward. Brighten 
the heads of the screws, set them, pomt 
downward, into the holes already drilled, 
and expose the bottom of the barrel to 
the lamp until the screws assume tne 
color you wish.

Hiello.— This is a brightly polished 
metal, which is provided with a black or 
blue-black foundation by heating, is cov- 
ered with a design by the use of a suitable 
matrix and then treated with hydro- 
chloric acid in such a manner that only 
the black ground is attacked, the metal 
underneath remaining untouched. Next, 
the acid is rinsed off and the reserve is 
removed with suitable solvents. The 
parts of the metal bared by the acid may 
also be provided with a galvanic coating 
of silver or other metal. 

Another method is to plunge the articles 
for a few minutes into a solution of ox- 
alic acid and to clean them by passing 
them through alcohol. In this way the 
polish can even be brought back with- 
out the use of rouge or diamantine. 

Whitening or Blanching. — If dissatis- 
fied with the color acquired in tempering, 
dip the article into an acid bath, which 
whitens it, after which the bluing opera- 
tion is repeated. This method is of great 
service, but it is important to remember 
always thoroughly to wash after the use 
ot acid and then allow the object to re- 
main for a few minutes in alcohol. Sul- 
Phunc acid does not whiten well, often 
l avi "K dark shades on the surface. Hy- 
^ochlonc acid gives better results. Small 
Pieces of steel are also whitened with a 
yiece of pith moistened with dilute sul- 



phuric acid, else the fine steel work, such 
as a watch hand, is fixed with lacquer on 
a plate and whitened by means of pith 
and polishing rouge, or a small stiff brush 
is charged with the same material. It is 
then detached by heating and cleaned in 
hot alcohol. 

TEMPERING STEEL. 

The best temperature at which to 
quench in the tempering of tool steel is 
the one just above the transformation 
point of the steel, and this temperature 
may be accurately determined in the fol- 
lowing manner, without the use of a 
pyrometer. The pieces of steel are in- 
troduced successively at equal intervals 
of time into a muffle heated to a temper- 
ature a little above the transformation 
point of the steel. If, after a certain 
time, the pieces be taken out in the re- 
verse order they will at first show pro- 
gressively increasing degrees of brightness, 
these pieces being at the transformation, 
point. When this point is passed the 
pieces again rapidly acquire a brightness 
superior to that of their neighbors and 
should then be immediately quenched. 

I.— Heat red hot and dip in an un- 
euent made of mercury and the fat of 
bacon. This produces a remarkable 
degree of hardness and the steel pre-

lift P This is dissolved in varying pro- 
portions of weight, a saturated solution 
& generally used as a quenching 
Sure. The use of tbis solution is 
Sways advisable when tools of eom- 
p Heated shape, for which a considerable 
Seeree of hardness is necessary, are to be 
tempered in large quantities or ^ fre- 
quent succession. In using these cooling 
fluids, care must be taken that a suffi- 
cient quantity is added to the water to 
prevent any great rise of temperature 
when the tempering process is pro- 
tracted. For this reason the Ingest 
possible vessels should be used, wide and 
shallow, rather than narrow and deep, 
vessels being selected. Carbonate of soda 
and sal ammoniac do not increase the 
tempering action to the same extent as 
common salt, and are therefore not so 
frequently employed, though they form 
excellent additions to tempering water in 
certain cases. Tools of very complicated 
construction, such as fraises, where the 
danger of fracture of superficial parts 
has always to be kept in view, can with 
advantage be tempered in a solution of 
soda or sal ammoniac. Acids increase 
the action of tempering water consider- 
ably, and to a far greater extent than 
common salt. They are added in quan- 
tities up to 2 per cent, and frequent- 
ly in combination with salts. Organ- 
ic acids (e. g., acetic or citric) have a 
milder action than mineral acids (e. g., 
hydrochloric, nitric, or sulphuric). Acid- 
ulous water is employed in tempering 
tools for which the utmost degree of 
hardness is necessary, such as instru- 
ments for cutting exceptionally hard ob- 

Ieets, or when a sufficiently hard surface 
las to be given to a kind of steel not 
capable of much hardening. Alcohol 
lowers the boiling point of water, and 
causes so vigorous an evaporation when 
the water comes in contact with the red- 
hot metal, that the tempering is greatly 
retarded (in proportion to the' amount of 
alcohol in the mixture). Water con- 
taining a large quantity of alcohol will 
not temper. Soap and soap suds will 
not temper steel; this property is made 
US u- 1 f m the ra P id eo °lirig of steel for 
which a great degree of hardness is not 



desirable. When certain parte of com 
pletely tempered steel have to be rendered 
soft, these parts are heated to a red heat 
and then cooled in soap suds. This i s 
done with the tangs of files, knives 
swords, saws, etc. Soluble organic subl 
stances retard the tempering process j n 
proportion to the quantity used, and 
thus lessen the effect of pure water. 
Such substances (e. g., milk, sour beer' 
etc.) are employed only to a limited 
extent. 

To Caseharden Locally. — In case- 
hardening certain articles it is sometimes 
necessary, or desirable, to leave spots ut 
sections m the original soft uncarbonized 
condition while the remainder is carbon- 
ized and hardened. This may be ef- 
fected by first covering the parts to be 
hardened with a protecting coat of japan, 
and allowing it to dry. Then put the 
piece in an electroplating bath and de- 
posit a heavy coat of nickel over the 
parts not protected by the japan. The 
piece thus prepared may be treated in 
the usual manner in casehardening. 
The coat of nickel prevents the metal 
beneath being carbonized, so it does not 
harden when" dipped in the bath. 

A plating of copper answers the same 
purpose as nickel and is often used. A 
simpler plan, where the shape of the 
piece permits, is to protect it from the 
action of the carbonizing material with 
an iron pipe or plate closely fitted or 
luted with clay. Another scheme is to 
machine the parts wanted soft alter 
carbonizing but before hardening. W 
this procedure the carbonized material u 
removed where the metal is desired soil, 
and when heated and dipped these parts 
do not harden.

fSt It is most advantageous if a 
Serial of the thickness and shape of 
Se wring can be obtained which, by 
bending aid pressing through, is shaped 
iato the desired spring. Since tins also 
entails slight tension, a careful annealing 
is advisable, so as to prevent cracking or 
distorting in hardening. The annealing 
is best conducted with exclusion ot the 
air by placing the springs m a sheet-iron 
box provided with a cover, smearing all 
the joints well up with loam. 1 he heat- 
ing may be done in a muffled furnace; 
the box, with contents, is, not too slowly, 
heated to cherry red and then allowed to 
cool gradually, together with the stove. 
The springs must only be taken out 
when they have cooled off enough that 
they will give off no hissing sound when 
touched by water. In order to uniform- 
ly heat the springs for hardening, a 
muffle furnace is likewise employed, 
■wherein they are heated to cherry-red 
heat. For cooling liquid, a mixture of oil, 
tallow, and petroleum is employed. A 
mass consisting of fish oil, tallow, and 
Wax also renders good service, but one 
should see to it that there is a sufficient 
quantity of these cooling liquids, so that 
the springs may be moved about, same 
as when cooled in water, without causing 
an appreciable increase in the tempera- 
ture of the liquid. In most cases top 
small a quantity of the liquid is responsi- 
ble for the many failures in hardening. 
When the springs have cooled in the 
gardening liquid, they are taken out, 
dned off superficially, and the oil still 
adhering is burned off over a charcoal 
^ re - This enables one to moderate the 
temper according to the duration of the 



k F C1 according to the duration ot tne 
owning off and to produce the desired 
elasticity. An even heating being of 
thp i lm P°riance in hardening springs, 
oparf n" 0 curr ent has of late been suc- 
sstull y employed for this purpose. 



To Temper a Tap.— After the tap has 
been cut and finished heat it in a pair of 
tongs to a blood-red heat over a charcoal 
fire or the blue flame of a Bunsen burner 
or blow pipe, turning it around so that 
one point does not get heated before 
another. Have ready a pail of clean, 
cold water, into which a handful of com- 
mon salt has been put. _ Stir the water in 
the pail so that a whirlpool is set up. 
Then plunge the tap, point first and 
vertically, into the vortex to cool. The 
turning of the tap during heating, as well 
as the swirl of the quenching water, pre- 
vents distortion. In tempering, the tem- 

J)er of the tap requires to be drawn to a 
ight straw color, and this may be done 
as follows: Get a piece of cast-iron tube 
about 3 inches in diameter and heat it to 
a dull-red heat for about 4 inches of its 
length. Then hold the tap, with the 
tongs, up the center of the tube, mean- 
while turning the tap around until the 
straw color appears all over it. Then 
dip the tap in the water, when it will be 
found perfectly hard. The depth of the 
color, whether light or dark straw, must 
be determined by the nature of the cast 
steel being used, which can be gained 
only from experience of the steel. 

Scissors Hardening.— The united legs 
of the scissors are uniformly heated to a 
dark cherry red, extending from the 
point to the screw or rivet hole, this 
may be done in the naked fire, a feeble 
current of air being admitted until the 
steel commences to glow. , Then the fire 
is left to itself and the scissor parts are 
drawn to and fro in the fire, untd all the 
parts to be hardened show a uniform 
Itrk cherry red. The two legs are

Into this liquid the steel, heated, for 
example, to a cherry red, is dipped. A

To Remove Burnt Oil from Hardened 
Steel. — To remove excess oil from parts 
that have been hardened in oil, place the 
articles in a small tank of gasoline, whi ch, 
when exposed to the air, will dry off 
immediately, allowing the part to be 
polished and tempered without the con- 
fusing and unsightly marks of burnt oil. 

VARIOUS RECIPES: 

To Put an Edge on Steel Tools. — 
Aluminum will put an edge on fine cut- 
ting instruments such as surgical knives, 
razors, etc. It acts exactly like a razor- 
hone of the finest quality. When steel 
is rubbed on the aluminum, as, for in- 
stance, in honing a knife blade, the met- 
al disintegrates, forming an infinitely 
minute powder of a greasy unctuous 
quality that clings to steel with great 
tenacity and thus assists in cutting away 
the surface of the harder metal. So fine 
is the edge produced that it can in no 

W1S ^ • ? e finer °y the strop, which 
used in the ordinary way merely tends to 
round the edge. 

To Restore Burnt Steel.— To restore 
burnt cast steel heat the piece to a red

To Remove Strains in Metal by Heat 
ing, — In making springs of piano wi re 
or, in fact, any wire, if the metal « 
heated to a moderate degTee the spring 
will be improved. Piano or any s t ef jj 
wire should be heated to a blue, brass 
w ire to a degree sufficient to cause tal 
low to smoke. Heating makes the met 
al homogeneous; before heating, it is f ul 
of strains. 

If a piece of metal of any kind ig 
straightened cold and then put into a 
lathe and a chip turned off, it will be far from 
true. Before turning, it was held true bj 
the strain of the particles on the outside, 
they having changed position, while the 
particles near the axis are only sprung, 
The outside particles being removed b> 
the lathe tool, the sprung particles at the 
center return to their old positions, h 
after straightening, the metal is heated 
to a temperature of 400° F., the particles 
settle together and the strains are re 
moved. 

This is the case in the manufacture 01 
saws. The saw is first hardened and 
tempered and then straightened on an 
anvil by means of a hammer. After it f 
hammered true, it is ground and po hshec 
a little, then blued to stiffen it and thee 
is subjected to the grinding process

Testing Steel. — A bar of the steel to 
be tested is provided w.Ui about nine 
Mrhes running around it in distances of 
Sou of an inch. Next, the foremost 
nKed piece is heated in a forge in 
such a manner that the remaining por- 
tion of the bar is heated less by the fire 
proper than by the transmitted heat. 
When the foremost piece is heated to 
burning, i. e. } to combustion, and the 
color of the succeeding pieces gradually 
passes to dark-brownish redness the 
whole rod is hardened. A test with the 
file will now show that the foremost 
burned piece possesses the greatest hard- 
ness, that several softer pieces will follow, 
and that again a piece ordinarily situ- 
ated in the second third, whose tempera- 
ture was the right one for hardening, is 
almost as hard as Jhe first one. If the 
different pieces are knocked off, the 
fracture of the piece hardened at the 
correct temperature exhibits the finest 
grain. This will give one an idea of the 
temperature to be smployed for harden- 
ing the steel in question and its behavior 
in general. Very hard steel will readily 
crack in this process. 

Welding Compound. — Boracic acid, 
4H parts; common salt 35 parts; ferro- 
cyanide of potassium, St) parts; rosin, 
'4 parts; carbonate of sodium, 4 parts, 
^^t the pieces to be welded to a light- 
ed heat and apply the compound; then 
neat to a strong yellow heat and the 
gelding ma y be accomplished in the 
usual maimer. 

The precaution should be observed, 

1* Sa - n J e as with an y of tlle cyanides, 
avoid breathing the poisonous fumes. 

Softening Steel.— Heat the steel to a 
"own red and plunge into soft water, 



be tal7 atC u bein S the best - Uare shoulQ 
IpH *l ' howe ver, not to heat over brown , 
' otn erwise it will be hard when im- 



Care should 



mersed. The steel will be soft enough 
to be cut with ease if it is plunged in the 
water as soon as it turns red. 

Draw-Tempering Cast Steel.— First 
heat the steef lightly by means of char- 
coal until of a cherry-red shade, where- 
upon it is withdrawn to be put quickly 
into ashes or dry charcoal dust until 
completely cooled. The steel may also 
be heated in the forge to a red cherry 
color, then hammered until it turns blue 
and then plunged into water. 

Drilling Hard Steel. — To accomplish 
the object quickly, a drill of cast steel 
should be made, the point gradually 
heated to the red, the scales taken off, 
and the extremity of the point immersed 
at once in quicksilver; then the whole 
quenched in cold water. Thus prepared, 
the drill is equal to any emergency; it will 
bore through the hardest pieces. _ The 
quantity of quicksilver needed is trifling. 

Engraving or Etching on Steel. — Dis- 
solve in 150 parts of vinegar, sulphate of 
copper, 30 parts; alum, 8 parts; kitchen 
salt, 11 parts. Add a few drops of 
nitric acid. According to whether this 
liquid is allowed to act a longer or 
shorter time, the steel may be engraved 
upon deeply or the surface may be given 
a very ornamental, frosted appearance. 

To Distinguish Steel from Iron.— Take 
a very clean file and file over the flame 
of aTalcohol lamp. If the filed piece » 
made of steel, little burning and crack- 
Ung sparks will be seen. If it consists of 
iron/ the sparks will not crackle.

ture of manganese and lampblack, etc., 
etc White lead cannot be used, as it 
coagulates with the water glass, nor 
vermilion, because it fades greatly under 
the action of the light. The plastering 
to be coated must be porous, not fresh, 
but somewhat hardened. Otherwise 
the caustic lime of the plaster will 
quickly decompose the water glass. This 
circumstance may account for the un- 
satisfactory results which have fre- 
quently been obtained with water-glass 
coatings. Before applying the paint the 
wall should first be impregnated with a 
water-glass solution. The colors may 
be kept on hand ground, but must be 
protected from contact with the air. If 
air is admitted a partial separation of 
silica in the form of a jelly takes place. 
Only pure potash water glass, or, at 
least, such as only contains little soda, 
should be used, as soda will cause efflor- 
escence.

imitation of lapis laz\ili is obtained hj 
the simultaneous employment of Cassel

oxides yield the corresponding silicates, 
and zinc oxide, mixed with cleansed

mechanical kneading trough, furnished 
with stirrers, in variable proportions, 
according to the percentage of the solu- 
tion of alkaline silicate. The whole is 
afterwards molded or compressed by the 
ordinary processes. 

The imitation of granite is obtained by

applying it to the surface of the heavy 
liquid. A suitable composition with 
which the colors may be mixed consists 
of: Oil of turpentine, 100 parts; colo-

siccatif soleil, 5 parts. The heavy liq-

any colors, organic or mineral, may be

CONCRETE. 

Concrete is the name applied to an 
artificial combination of various mineral 
substances which under chemical action 
become incorporated into a solid mass, 
lhere are one or two compositions of 

; comparatively trifling importance which 
receive the same name, though differing 
tundarnentally from true concrete, their 
soudifacation being independent of chem- 
fx\ l nflueilc e. These compositions only 

i ""I tor passing mention; they are: Tar

L Conr"^' SUch as for fortifications, 
two^ proper consists essentially of 
first te UpS °. r classes of ingredients. The 
t Renpm,J me tne aggregate, is a heteror 
i Us ma ss, in itself inactive, of 



mineral material, such as shingle, broken 
stone, broken brick, gravel, and sand. 
Inese are the substances most com- 
monly in evidence, but other ingredients 
are also occasionally employed, such as 
slag from iron furnaces. Burnt clay, in 
any form, and earthenware, make ad- 
mirable material for incorporation. The 
second class constitutes the active agency 
which produces adhesion and solidifica- 
tion. It is termed the matrix, and con- 
sists of hydraulic lime or cement, com- 
bined with water. 

One of the essential features in good 
concrete is cleanliness and an entire 
absence of dirt, dust, greasy matter, and 
impurities of any description. The ma- 
terial will preferably be sharp and angu- 
lar, with a rough, porous surface, to 
which the matrix will more readily 
adhere than to smooth, vitreous sub- 
stances. The specific gravity of the ag- 
gregate will depend upon the purpose for 
which the concrete is to be used. For 
beams and lintels, a light aggregate, such 
as coke breeze from gasworks, is per- 
missible, especially when the work is 
designed to receive nails. On the other 
hand, for retaining walls, the heaviest 
possible aggregate is desirable on the 
ground of stability. 

The aggregate by no means should be 
uniform in size. Fragments of different 
dimensions are most essential, so that 
the smaller material may fill up the 
interstices of the larger. It is not in- 
frequently stipulated by engineers that 
no individual fragment shall be more 
than 4 inches across, and the material is 
often specified to pass through a rine 1 * 
to 2 inches in diameter. The absolute 
limits to size for the aggregate, however, 
are determinable by a number of con- 
siderations, not the least ^Pjrtant^ 
which is the magnitude and bulk of the 
work in which it is to be employed. The 
particles of sand should also be of vary- 
ing degrees of coarseness Ah ne dust

subdivision prevents complete contact

US Tne quantity of mortar required in 
reference to the aggregate is based on the 
vaSes kx the latter. For any particu- 
lar affgregate the amount of empty space 
Zjf eletermined by filling a tank of 
known volume with the minerals and 
then adding sufficient water to bring to 
a level surface. The volume of water 
added (provided, of course, the aggregate 
be impervious or previously saturated) 
gives the net volume of mortar required. 
To this it is necessary to make some ad- 
dition (say 10 per cent of the whole), m 
order to insure the thorough flushing ol 
every part of the work. 

Assuming that the proportion of 
interstices is 30 per cent and adding 10 
for the reason just stated, we derive 40 
parts as the quantity of mortar to 100 — 
10 = 90 parts of the aggregate. An 
allowance of \ volume for shrinkage 
brings the volume of the dry materials 
(sand and cement) of the mortar to 
40 + 40/3 = 53^ parts, which, divided in 
the ratio of 1 to 3, yields: 
53J.

The cost of concrete may be materially 
reduced without affecting the strength or 
efficacy of the work, by a plentiful use of 
stone "plums" or "burrs." These arc 
bedded in the fluid concrete during it 3 
deposition in situ, but care must be taken 
to see that they are thoroughly sur . 
rounded by mortar and not in contact 
with each other. Furthermore, if they 
are of a porous nature, they should be 
well wetted before use. 

The mixing of concrete is important. 
If done by hand, the materials forming 
the aggregate will be laid out on a plat- 
form and covered by the cement in a thin 
layer. The whole should be turned over 
thrice in the dry state, and as many 
times wet, before depositing, in order to 
bring about thorough and complete 
amalgamation. Once mixed, the con- 
crete is to be deposited immediately and 
allowed to remain undisturbed until the 
action of setting is finished. Deposition 
should be effected, wher-ver possible, 
without tipping from a height of more 
than about 6 feet, as in greater falls tuere 
is a likelihood of the heavier portions of 
the aggregate separating from the lighter.

As the resultant concrete is 100 parts, 
the total shrinkage is 30 per cent. 
Expressed in terms of the cement, the 
concrete would have a composition of 1

and broken stone, and it would form, 
approximately, what is commonly known 
as 7 to 1 concrete.

These figures show how greatly the 
strength is improved by adding coarse 
material, even though the proportion of 
cement is thereby reduced. A mixture of 
1 to 12 J of properly proportioned sand 
and gravel is, in fact, stronger than 1 to ' 
4, and nearly as strong as 1 to 3, of 
cement and sand only. 

In selecting materials for concrete, 
those should be chosen which give the 
greatest density. If it is practicable to 
mix two materials, as sand and gravel, 
the proportion which gives the greatest 
density should be determined by ex- 
periment, and rigidly adhered to in 
making concrete, whatever proportion of 
cement it is decided to use. Well-pro- 
portioned dry sand and gravel or sand 
and broken stone, well shaken down, 
should weigh at least 125 pounds per 
cubic foot. Limestone screenings, owing 
to minute pores in the stone itself, are 
somewhat lighter, though giving equally 
strong concrete. They should weigh at 
least 120 pounds per cubic foot, if the 
weight is less, there is probably too much 
fine dust in the mixture. 

The density and strength of concrete 
are also ereatly improved by use of a 

miake strongly when rammed. It mixea

gravel are, in most cases 
material to use for block work. The 
nresence of a few per cent of clay or 
Foam is not harmfnl provided the mixing 
is thorough. Stone screenings, it ot 
good quality, give fully as strong concrete 
a° sand and gravel, and usually yield 
blocks of somewhat lighter color. Screen- 
ings from soft stone should be avoided, 
also such as contain too much dust. 
This can be determined from the weight 
per cubic foot, and by a sifting test. It 
more than two-thirds pass J inch, and 
the weight (well jarred down) is less than 
120 pounds, the material is not the best. 

Cinders are sometimes used for block 
work; they vary greatly in quality, but if 
clean and of medium coarseness will give 
fair results. Cinder concrete never de- 
velops great strength, owing to the por- 
ous character and crushability of the 
cinders themselves. Cinder blocks may, 
however, be strong enough for many 
purposes, and suitable for work in which 
great strength is not required. 

Lime. — It is well known that slaked 
lime is a valuable addition to cement 
mortar, especially for use in air. In 
sand mixtures, 1 to 4 or 1 to 5, at least 
one-third of the cement may be replaced 
by slaked lime without loss of strength. 
The_ most convenient form of lime for 
use in block-making is the dry-slaked or 
hydrate lime, now a common article of 
commerce. This is, however, about as 
expensive as- Portland cement, and there 
is no great saving in its use. Added to 
block concrete, in the proportion of i to 
4 tbe cement used, it will be found to 
make the blocks lighter in color, denser, 
*ua decidedly less permeable by water. 

Cement. — Portland cement is the only 



hydraulic material to be seriously Ccm 
sidered by the blockmajcer. >f at 
and slag cements and hydraulic lime 
useful for work which remains constant!, 
wet, but greatly inferior in strength and 
durability when exposed to dry a j t . ? 
further advantage of Portland cement k 
the promptness with which it hardens 
and develops its i hill strength; this 
quality alone is sumeient to put all other 
cements out of consideration for block 
work. 



Proportions. — There are three un. 
portant considerations to be kept in view 
in adjusting the proportions of materials 
for block concrete — strength, permea- 
bility, and cost. So far as strength goes, 
it may easily be shown that concretes 
very poor in cement, as 1 to 8 or 1 to 10, 
will have a crushing resistance far be- 
yond any load that they may be called 
upon to sustain. Such concretes are, 
however, extremely porous, and absorb 
water like a sponge. The blocks must 
bear a certain amount of rough hand- 
ling at the factory and while being carted 
to work and set up in the wall. Safety 
in this respect calls for a much greater 
degree of hardness than would be needed 
to bear the weight of the building. Agam, 
strength and hardness, with a given pro- 
portion of cement, depend greatly on the 
character of the other materials used; 
blocks made of cement and sand, I to J, 
will not be so strong or so impermeabl 
to water as those made from J good ^ 
sand and gravel, 1 to fi. On the whole, rt 
is doubtful whether blocks of 
quality can be made, by hand 
and tamping, under ordwmgfa*g 
conditions, from a poorer 
1 to 5. Even this proportion i req u£» 
good results the use of properi y ^

Proportion of Water.— This is a 
matter of the utmost consequence, and 
has more effect on the quality of the work 
than is generally supposed. Blocks 
made from too dry concrete wilt always 
remain soft and weak, no matter how 
thoroughly sprinkled afterwards. On 
the other hand, if blocks are to be re- 
moved from the machine as soon as 
made, too much water will cause them 
to stick to the plates and sag out of 
shape. It is perfectly possible, how- 
ever, to give the concrete enough water 
for maximum density and first-class 
hardening properties, and still to remove 
the blocks at once from the mold. _A 
good proportion of coarse material 
allows the mixture to be made wetter 
without sticking or sagging. Use of 
plenty of water vastly improves the 
strength, hardness, and waterproof qual- 
ities of blocks, and makes them decid- 
edly lighter in color. The rule should 
be: 

Use as much water as possible with- 
out causing the blocks to stick to the 
plates or to sag out of shape on removing 
nom the machine.

for th Water ' when the proper quantity 
tae materials used has been deter- 



mined, should always be accurately meas- 
ured out for each batch. In this way 
much time is saved and uncertainty 
avoided. 

Facing. — Some blockmakers put on 
a facing of richer and finer mixture, 
making the body of the block of poorer 
and coarser material. As will be ex- 
plained later, the advantage of the prac- 
tice is, in most cases, questionable, but 
facings may serve a good purpose in case 
a colored or specially waterproof surface 
is required. Facings are generally made 
of cement and sand, or fine screenings, 

Eassing a J-inch sieve. To get the same 
ardness and strength as a 1 to 5 gravel 
mixture, at least as rich a facing as 1 to 
3 will be found necessary. Probably 
1 to 2 will be found better, and if one- 
third the cement be replaced by hydrate 
lime the waterproof qualities and ap- 
pearance of the blocks will be improved. 
A richer facing than 1 to 2 is liable to 
show greater shrinkage than the body of 
the block, and to adhere imperfectly or 
develop hair-cracks in consequence. 

Poured Work. — The above sugges- 
tions on the question of proportions of 
cement, sand, and gravel for tamped 
blocks apply equally to concrete made 
very wet, poured into the mold, and 
allowed to harden a day or longer before 
removing. Castings in a sand mold are 
made by the use of very liquid concrete; 
sand and gravel settle out too rapidly 
from such thin mixtures, and rather fane 
limestone screenings are generally used. 

Mixing.— To get the full benefit of the 
cement used it Is necessary that all the 
materials shall be very thoroughly mixed 
together. The strength of the block as 
a whole will be only as .feat as that of 
its weakest part, and it is the height 
of folly, after putting a liberal measure

They should be provided with exten- 
sible arms of chilled iron, which can be

Concrete Block Systems. — For smaller 
and less costly buildings, separate blocks, 
made at the factory and built up into the 
walls in the same manner as brick or 
blocks of stone, are simpler, less ex- 
pensive, and much more rapid in con- 
struction than monolithic work. They 
also avoid some of the faults to which 
solid concrete work, unless skillfully 
done, is subject, such as the formation of 
shrinkage cracks. 

There are two systems of block mak- 
ing, differing in the consistency of the 
concrete used: 

1. Blocks tamped or pressed from 
semi-wet concrete, and removed at once 
from the mold. 

2. Blocks poured or tamped from wet 
concrete, and allowed to remain in the 
mold until hardened. 

Tamped Blocks from Semi-Wet Mix- 
tur ®* These are practically always 
made on a block machine, so arranged 
that as soon as a block is formed the 
+u te ?i and sirle Phites are removed and 
the block lifted from the machine. By 
tar the larger part of the blocks on the 
market are made in this way. "Usually 
mese are of the one-piece type, in which a 



single block, provided with hoiW * 
makes the whole thickness of the ^

which the face and back of the wai?* 111 
made up oi different blocks, 
over each other as to give a V> 0 nd P ^ 
hold the wall together. Blocks of a 
two-piece type are generally formed i« 
hand or hydraulic press. 11 * 

Various shapes and sizes of blocks 
commonly made; the buildcis of \\* 
most popular machines have, however 
adopted the standard length of 32 i Uc Jl 
and height of 9 inches for the fulU; z J 
block, with thickness of 8, 10, and \a 
inches. Lengths of 24, 16, and 8 inches 
are also obtained on the same machines 
by the use of parting plates and suitably 
divided face plates; any intermediate 
lengths and any desired heights may 
be produced by simple adjustments or 
blocking off. 

Blocks are commonly made plain, 
rock-faced, tool-faced, paneled, and ot 
various ornamental patterns. New de- 
signs of face plates are constantly being 
added by the most progressive machine 
makers. 

Block Machines. — There are many 
good machines on the market, most of 
which are of the same general type and 
differ only in mechanical details. They 
may be divided into two classes: those 
with vertical and those with horizontal 
face. In the former the ace pla e 
stands vertically, and the block is simp ? 
lifted from the machine, on its base plat 
as soon as tamped. In feo

sarily much less rapid than the machine

building blocks than for special orna- 
mental architectural work, sills, lintels, 
columns, capitals, etc., and for purposes 
of this kind it turns out products ot the 
highest quality and beauty. 

Tamping of Concrete Blocks. — This 
is generally done by means of hand 
rammers. Pneumatic tampers, operat- 
ed by an air compressor, are in use at a 
few plants, apparently with considerable 
saving in time and labor and improve- 
ments in quality of work. Hand tamping 
must be conscientious and thorough, or 
poor work will result. It is important 
that the mold should be filled a little at 
a time, tamping after each addition; at 
least four fillings and tarn pings should be 
given to each block. If the mixture is 
wet enough no noticeable layers will be 
formed by this process. 

Hardening and Storage. — Triple- 
decked cars to receive the blocks from 
the machines will be found a great sav- 
of labor, and are essential in factories 
ot considerable size. Blocks will gener- 
ally require to be left on the plates for at 
east 24 hours, and must then be kept 
uncier roof, in a well-warmed room, with

g ' blocks wdl be found to shrink at

will surely appear. 

Efflorescence, or the appearance of a 
White coating on the surfaces, sometimes 
takes place when blocks are repeatedly 
saturated with water and then dried out; 
blocks laid on the ground are more liable 
to show this defect. It results from 
diffusion of soluble sulphates of lime and 
alkalies to the surface. It tends to dis- 
appear in time, and rarely is sufficient in 
amount to cause any complaint. 

Properties of Concrete Blocks — 
Strength. — In the use of concrete blocks 
for the walls of buildings, the stress to 
whi^h they are subjected is almost en- 
tirely one of compression. In compres- 
sive strength well-made concrete does 
not differ greatly from ordinary building 
stone. It is difficult to find reliable 
records of tests of sand and gravel con- 
crete, 1 to 4 and 1 to 5, such as is used in 
making blocks; the following figures 
show strength of concrete of approxi- 
mately this richness, also the average 
of several samples each of well-known 
building stones, as stated by the author-

be 200 pounds per square inch, or 800 X 
109 - 38 400 pounds for the wnolc 
surface of the block. Dividing tins by 
Se weight of the block, 130 pounds, we 
findlhat 295 such blocks could be placed 
one upon another, making a total height 
of wail of 222 feet, and still the pressure 
on the lowest block won d be less than 
one-fifth of what it would actually bear. 
This shows how greatly the strength ot 
concrete blocks exceeds any demands 
that are ever made upon it m ordinary 
building construction. 

The safe load above assumed, 200 
pounds, seems low enough to guard 
against any possible failure. In Taylor 
and Thompson's work on concrete, a 
safe load of 450 pounds for concrete 1 to 
2 to 4 is recommended; this allows a 
factor of safety of B\. On the other 
hand, the Building Code of the city of 
Cleveland permits concrete to be loaded 
only to 150 pounds per square, inch, and 
limits the height of walls of 12-inch 
blocks to 44 feet. The pressure of such 
a wall would be only 40 pounds per 
square inch; adding the weight of two 
floors at 25 pounds per square foot each, 
and roof with snow and wind pressure, 
40 pounds per square foot, we find that 
with a span of 35 feet the total weight 
on the lowest blocks would be only 52 
pounds per square inch, or about one- 
twentieth of their minimum compression 
strength. 

Blocks with openings equal to only 
one-third the surface, as required in. 
many city regulations, are neavy to 
handle, especially for walls 12 inches 
and more in thickness, and, as the above 
ngiirea show, are enormously stronger 
than there is any need of. Blocks with 
openings of 50 per cent would be far 
more acceptable to the buildiug trade, 



and if used in walls not over 44 feet hit* 
with floors and roof calculated as a bSd 
for 25 feet span, would be loaded onh, t „ 
50 pounds per square inch of ac L., 
surface. This would gwe a factor J} 
safety of 18, assuming a minimum c oa 
pression strength of 1,000 pounds. 

There is no doubt that blocks wi^. 
one-third opening are inconveniently 
and unnecessarily heavy. Such a block 
32 inches long, 12 inches wide, and 9 
inches high, has walls about 3i inches 
thick, and weighs 180 pounds. \ 
block with 50 per cent open space would 
have walls and partitions 2 inches in 
thickness, and would weigh about 130 
pounds. With proper care in manu- 
facture, especially by using as much water 
as possible, blocks with this thickness of 
walls may be made thoroughly strong, 
sound, and durable. It is certainly 
better for strength and water-resisting 
qualities to make thin- walled blocks o{ 
rich mixture, rather than heavy blocks of 
poor and porous material. 

Filling the voids with cement is a 
rather expensive method of securing 
waterproof qualities, and gives stronger 
concretes than are needed. The same 
mav be accomplished more cheaply by 
replacing part of the cement by slaked 
lime, which is an extremely fine-grained 
material, and therefore very effective 
in closing pores. Hydrate lime is the 
most convenient material to use, uu 
nearly as costly as Portland cement t 
present prices. A 1 to 4 mixture J

erally foIlo ^ C ^ 0 p uUir ity would be greatly 
f thev were made sufficiently 
Sroof to allow plastering directly 
n the inside surface. 
For this purpose it is not necessary 
that blocks should be perfectly water- 
proof but only that the absorption of 
water shall be slow, so that it may pene- 
trate only part way through the wall 
during long-continued ram.. Walls 
made entirely water-tight are, in fact, 
obiectionable, owing to their tendency to 
"sweat" from condensation of moisture 
on the inside surface. For health and 
comfort, walls must be slightly porous, 
so that any moisture formed on the in- 
side may be gradually absorbed and 
carried away. 

Excessive water absorption may be 
avoided in the following ways: 

1. Use of Properly Graded Materials. 
—It has been shown by Feret and others 
that porosity and permeability are two 
different things; porosity is the total 
proportion of voids or open spaces in the 
mass, while permeability is the rate at 
which water, under a given pressure, will 
pass through it. Permeability depends 
on the size of the openings as well as on 
their total amount. In two masses of the 
same porosity or percentage of voids, 
one consisting of coarse and the other of 
fine particles, the permeability will be 
greater in the case of the coarse material. 
The least permeability, and also the 
least porosity, are, however, obtained by 
use of a suitable mixture of coarse and 
fine particles. Properly graded gravel or 
screenings, containing plenty of coarse 

tin 1611 * 5 and a ^ so enou S n nne material 
to nil up the pores, will be found to give 
a aucn less permeable concrete than fine 
or Coa rse sand used alone. 

2- Use of Rich Mixtures. — All con- 
iin l ate somewnat permeable by water 
under sufficient pressure. Mixtures rich 
naB cem . e . nt are of course much less 
Permeable than poorer mixtures. If the 
s1 T u . nt °f cement used is more than 

SSrT* to fiU the voids in the sand and 
mto v V t ry dense eoner «te ia obtained, 
exh. D 3 i , le Penetration of water is 
decS Y sW " The permeability also 
to tViV 68 co . nsid erably with age, owing 
cement S rad , ual crystallization of the 
ut m the pores, so that concrete 



which is at first quite absorbent may be- 
come practically impermeable after ex- 
posure to weather for a few weeks or 
T 0 "^ j • Tllere appears to be a very 
decided increase in permeability when 
the cement is reduced below the amount 
necessary to fill the voids. For example, 
a well-mixed sand and gravel weighing 
123 pounds per cubic foot, and therefore 
containing 25 per cent voids, will give a 
fairly impermeable concrete in mixtures 
up to 1 to 4, but with less cement will be 
found quite absorbent. A qjravel with 
only 20 per cent voids would give about 
equally good results with a 1 to 5 mix- 
ture; sucli gravel is, however, rarely met 
with in practice. < On the other hand, 
the best sand, mixed fine and coarse, 
seldom contains less than 33 per cent 
voids, and concrete made from such 
material will prove permeable if poorer 
than 1 to 3. 

3. Use of a Facing. — Penetration of 
water may be effectively prevented by 
giving the blocks a facing of richer 
mixture than the body. For the sake of 
smooth appearance, facings are generally 
made of cement and fine sand, and it is 
often noticed that these do not harden 
well. It should be remembered that a 
1 to 3 sand mixture is no stronger and 
little if any better in water absorption 
than a 1 to 5 mixture of well-graded sand 
and gravel. To secure good hardness 
and resistance to moisture a facing as 
rich as 1 to 2 should be used. 

4. Use of an Impervious Partition.—- 
When blocks are made on a horizontal 
face machine, it is a simple matter afte 
the face is tamped and cores pushed into 
place, to throw into each opening a sma 
amount of rich and rather wet mortar

Sort effectiVe remedy, in case a concrete 
bui ding proves damp, is to give the out- 
side wall? a very thin wash of cement 
suspended in water. . One or two coat, 
will be found sufficient. If too thick 
a coating is formed it will show hair 
cracks. The effect of the cement wash 
is to make the walls appear lighter m 
color, and if the coating is thin the ap- 
pearance is in no way injured. 

General Hints on Waterproof Quali- 
ties. — To obtain good water-resisting 
properties the first precaution is to 
make the concrete sufficiently wet. Dry- 
tamped backs, even from rich mixture, 
will always be porous and absorbent, 
while the same mixture in plastic con- 
dition will give blocks which are dense, 
strong, and water-tight. The difference 
in this respect is shown by the following 
tests of small concrete blocks, made by 
the writer. The concrete used was made 
of 1 part cement and 5 parts mixed fine 
and coarse sand, by weight. 

No. 1. "With 8 per cent water, rather 
dryer than ordinary block concrete, 
tamped in mold. 

No. 2. With 10 per cent water, 
tamped in the mold, and liiemold removed 
at once. 

No. 3. With 25 per cent water, 
poured into a mold resting on a flat 
surface of dry sand; after 1 hour the sur- 
face was troweled smooth; mold not 
removed until set. 

These blocks were allowed to harden a 
week m moist air, then dried. The

If one-third of the cement is replaced 
by hydrate lime the quality of the blocks 
will be improved, and the cost of 
material reduced about 10 per cent. 
The cost of labor required in manufac- 
turing, handling, and delivering blocks 
will vary with the locality and. the size 
and equipment of factory. With hand 
mixing, 3 men at an average of $1.75 each 
will easily make 75 8-inch or 50 12-inch 
blocks, with \ openings, per day. The 
labor cost for these sizes of blocks will 
therefore be 7 cents and 10 \ cents 
respectively. At a factory equipped with 
power concrete mixer and cars for trans- 
porting blocks, in which a number of 
machines are kept busy, the labor cost 
will be considerably less. An extensive 
industry located in a large city is, how- 
ever, subject to many expenses which 
are avoided in a small country plant, 
such as high wages, management, office 
rent, advertising, etc., so that the total 
cost of production is likely to be about 
the same in both cases. A fair estimate 
of total factory cost is as follows :

Artificial Marbles. — I. — The mass used 
by Beaumel consists of alum and heavy 
spar (barium sulphate) with addition of 
water and the requisite pigments. The 
following proportions have been found 
to be serviceable: Alum, 1,000 parts; 
heavy spar, 10 to 100 parts; water, 100 
parts; the amount of heavy spar being 
governed by the degree of translucence 
desired. The alum is dissolved in water 
with the use of heat. As soon as th 
solution boils the heavy spar is mixed in, 
stirred with water and the pigment; this 
is then boiled down until the mixture has 
lost about 3 per cent of its weight, a' 
which moment the mass exhibits a densi 
of 34° Be. at a temperature of 212° 
The mixture is allowed to cool with constan 
stirring until the substance is semi-liquid. 
The resultant mass is poured into a mol 
covered on the inside with several layer 
of collodion and the cast permitted t 
cool completely in the mold, whereupo 
it is taken out and dried entirely in an 
airy room. Subsequently the object may 
be polished, patinized, or finished in sor 
other way.

The mixture must be well shaken when 
used, and must not be applied when 
there is a fire or light near on account of 
the inflammability of the vapor. 

This form may be esteemed a con- 
venience by some, but the rosin and tur- 
pentine will, of course, give rise to some 
disagreeable odor on first heating the 
stove, after the liquid is applied.

yenience; of the latter, that it has better 
keeping qualities. In the cold process, 
the sugar is either stirred up in the water 
until it is dissolved, or water is percolated 
or filtered through the sugar, thus forming 
a solution, In the hot process, the sugar 
is simply dissolved in the water by the aid 
of heat, stirring until solution is effected. 
The strength of the syrup for fountain use 
should be about 6 pounds in the gallon 
of finished syrup; it is best, however, to 
make the stock syrup heavier, as it will 
keep much better, using 15 pounds of 
granulated sugar, and 1 gallon of water, 
When wanted for use it can be diluted 
to the proper density with water. The 
syrups of the market are of this con- 
centrated variety. Unless the apart- 
ments of the dispenser are larger than is 
usual, it is often best to buy the syrup, 
the difference in cost being so small that 
when the time is taken into considera- 
tion the profit is entirely lost. Foamed 
syrups should, however, never be pur- 
chased; they are either contaminated 
with foreign flavor, or are more prone to 
fermentation than plain syrup. 

Fruit Syrups. — These may be pre- 
pared from fruit juices, and the desired 
quantity of syrup, then adding soda 
foam, color, and generally a small 
amount of fruit- acid solution. They 
may also be made by reducing the con- 
centrated fruit syrups of the market with 
syrup, otherwise proceeding as above. 
As the fruit juices and concentrated 
syrups always have a tried formula at- 
tached, it is needless to use space for this 

PU When a flavor is weak it may be forti- 
fied by adding a small amount of flav- 
oring extract, but under no con ton 
should a syrup flavored entirely with an 
essence be handed out to the consumer 
« a Mt syrup, for there is really no 
great resemblance between the t <

The fruits for syrups must not only be 
fully ripe, but they must bejjed im^ 
diately after gathering. The fr git : must 
be freed from stems, seeds, etc. filled into 
lightly tied linen sacks, and thus sub- 
jected to pressure, to obtain their juices. 
Immediately after jpres sure the juice 
should be heated quickly to 167 F., -and 
filtered through a felt bag. The filtrate 
should fall directly upon the sugar neces- 
sary to make it a syrup. The heating 
serves the purpose of coagulating the al- 
buminous bodies present in the juices, 
and thus to purify the latter. 

Syrups thus prepared have not only a 
most agreeable, fresh taste, but are very 
stable, remaining in a good condition 
for years. 

Hints on Preparation of Syrups. — 
Keep the extracts in a cool, dark place. 
Never add flavoring extracts to hot 
syrup. It will cause them to evaporate, 
and weaken the flavor. Keep all the 
mixing utensils scrupulously clean. 
Never mix fruit syrups, nor let them 
stand in the same vessels in which sarsa- 
parilla, ginger, and similar extract flavors 
are mixed and kept. If possible, always 
use distilled water in making syrup. 
Never_ allow a syrup containing acid to 
come in contact with any metal except 
pure block tin. Clean the syrup jars 
each time before refilling. "Keep all 
packages of concentrated syrups and 
crushed fruits tightly corked. Mix only a 
small quantity of crushed fruit in the bowl 
at a time, so as to have it always fresh. 

How to Make Simple Syrups— Hot 
Process. — Put 25 pounds granulated 
sugar in a large pail, or kettle, and pour 
on arid stir hot water enough to make 
* gallons, more or less depending on how 
I&T S 1 yru P is desired. Then strain 
while hot through fine cheese cloth.

Cold Process. — By agitation. g u _ n 
25 pounds; water, 2 gallons. Vni iC 
sugar in a container, add the water a J5 
agitate with a wooden paddle until fl» 
sugar is dissolved. An earthenw aTe -7 
with a cover and a faucet at the bottom 
makes a very convenient container. 

Cold Process, 
good, easy way 
all the time: 

iron percolator, » feet long, 8 inches 
across top, and 4 inches at base, with a 
4-inch wire sieve in bottom. Finish the 
bottom in shape of a funnel. P u t a 
syrup faucet in a barrel, and set on a hox 
so that the syrup can be drawn iuto a gallon' 
measure. Bore a hole in the barrel head, 
and insert the percolator. Fill three- 
fourths full of sugar, and fill with -water. 
As fast as the syrup runs into the barrel 
fill the percolator^ always putting in plenty 
of sugar. By this method 20 to 25 gal- 
lons heavy syrup can be made in a day. 



Rock-Candy Syrup. — Sugar, 32 pounds; 
water, % gallons. Put the sugar and 
water in a suitable container, set on 
stove, and keep stirring until the mixture 
boils up once. Strain and allow to cool. 
When cool there will be on top a crust, 
or film, of crystallized sugar. Strain 
again to remove this film, and the prod- 
uct will be what is commonly known as 
rock-candy syrup. This may be reduced 
with one-fifth of its bulk of water when 
wanted for use.

Note. — The estimate 450 drops to the 
ounce, while accurate and reliable 
enough in this particular relation, must 
not be relied upon for very exact purposes, 
in which, as has frequently been demon- 
strated, the drop varies within a very wide 
raage, according to the nature of the 
liquid, its consistency, specific gravity, 
temperature; the size and shape of the 
aperture from which it is allowed to 
escape, etc.

indicated in sufficient water to make o Qe 

imperial pint. 

For -h Per cent or 1 m 5,000 solution 

use 1| grains of the medicament. 

For -Jj per cent, or 1 in 2,000 solution 

use 4| grains of the medicament. 

For fs P er cent ' or 1 in 1 ' 000 solution 
use 8£ grains of the medicament. 

For I per cent, or 1 in 400 solution, 
use 21 § grains of the medicament. 

For i per cent, or 1 in 200 solution, 
use 43|"grains of the medicament. 

For 1 per cent, or 1 in 100 solution, 
use 87 h grains of the medicament. 

For 2 per cent, or 1 in 50 solution, 
use 175 grains of the medicament. 

For 4 per cent, or 1 in 25 solution, 
use 350 grains of the medicament. 

For 5 per cent, or 1 in 20 solution, 
use 437^ grains of the medicament. 

For 10 per cent, or 1 in 10 solution, 
use 875 grains of the medicament. 

To make smaller quantities of any 
solution, use less water and reduce the 
medicament in proportion to the amount 
of water employed; thus i imperial pint 
of a 1 per cent solution will require «J 
grains of the medicament.

TANK: 

To Estimate Contents of a Cir- 
cular Tank. — The capacity of a circular 
tank may be determined by multiplying 
the diameter in inches by itself and by 
■7854 and by the length (or depth) in 
inches, which gives the capacity of the 
tank in inches, and then dividing by 231, 
the number of cubic inches in a United 
States gallon. 

TAPS, TO REMOVE BROKEN: 

First clean the hole by means of a 
small squirt gun filled with kerosene. All 
broken pieces of the tap can be removed 
a pair of tweezers, which should be 
^ la rge as possible. Then insert the 
tweezers between the hole and flutes of

TATTOO MARKS, REMOVAL 

OF; 

Apply a highly concentrated tannin 
solution on the tattooed places and treat 
them with the tattooing needle as the 
tattooer does. Next vigorously rub the 
places with a lunar caustic stick and 
allow the silver nitrate to act for some 
time, until the tattooed portions have 
turned entirely black. Then take off by 
dabbing. At first a silver tannate forms 
on the upper layers of the skin, which 
dyes the tattooing black; with slight 
symptoms of inflammation a scurf ensues 
which comes off after 14 to 16 days, 
leaving behind a reddish scar. The latter 
assumes the natural color of the skin 
after some time. The process is said to 
have given good results. 



TEETH, TO PREVENT DECAY: 

Lime water made from coarse unslake 
lime, is an excellent preventive of decay- 
crush the lime to a powder, then take 
half cupful of the powdered lime and p 
in a quart bottle of cold water. Shp 
thoroughly. Allow the undissolved L 
to settle at the bottom of the hottl 
This will take some little time. After 
has settled, pour off as much of the cle 
water as can be poured 
any of the lime. Again fiU the bottle wrt 
cold water, shake well and al o w the sol
