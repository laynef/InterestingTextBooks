GOLD PURPLE. 

T —The solution of stannous chloride 
necessary for the preparation of gold 
SS3e « produced by dissolving pure tin 
i P n pure hydrochloric acid (free from iron), 
nsuch a manner that some of the tin re- 
S undissolved, and, evaporating the 
solution, into which a piece of tin is laid, 
to crystallization. 

TT . — Recipe for Pale Purple.— Dis- 
solve 2 parts by wsight of tin m boiling 
fnua reeia, evaporate the solution at a 
moderate heat until it becomes solid 
dissolve in distilled water and add 2 
narts by weight of a solution o stannous 
SloridJ (specific gravity 1.7) dilute with 
9 856 parti by weight of water s Ur into 
the liquid a solution of gold chloride 
prepared from 0.5 parts by weight of 
Sold and containing no excess of acid 
(the latter being brought about by 
evaporating the solution of gold chloride 
to dryness and healing for some time to 
about 320° F.). This liquid is dimmed 
by the admixture of 50 parts by weight 
of liquid ammonia which eliminates the 
nurple. The latter is quickly altered oft, 
washed out and while still moist rubbed 
up with the glass paste. This consists of 
enamel of lead 20 parts by weight; 
quartzose sand, 1 part by weight; .red 
lead, 2 parts by weight; and calcined 
borax, 1 part by weight, with silver 
carbonate, 3 parts by weight. 

HI.— Recipe for Dark Gold Purple.— 

Gold solution of 0.5 parts by weight of 
gold, solution of stannous chloride 
(specific gravity 1.7) 7.5 parts by weight; 
thin with 9,856 parts by weight of water 
separate the purple by a few drops ot 
sulphuric acid, wash out the purple and 
mix same with enamel of lead 10 parts by 
weight and silver carbonate, 0.5 parts 
by weight. 



IV.— Recipe for Pink Purple.— Gold 
solution of 1 part by weight of gold; 
solution of 50 parts by weight of alum m 
19,712 parts by weight of water; add l.a 
parts by weight of stannous chloride so- 
lution (specific gravity 1.7) and enough 
ammonia until no more precipitate is 
formed; mix the washed out precipitate, 
while still moist, with 70 parts by weight 
of enamel of lead and 2.5 parts by weight 
of silver carbonate. According to the 
composition of the purple various reds 
are obtained in fusing it on: the latter 
may still be brightened up by a suitable 
increase of the flux. 



To Render Pale Gold Darker.— Tak 

verdigris, 50 parts by weight and ver 
strong vinegar, 100 parts by weigh 
Dissolve the verdigris in the vinegar, ru 
the pieces with it well, heat them and. di 
them in liquid ammonia diluted wit 
water. Repeat the operation if the d 
sired shade does not appear the first tinv 
Rinse with clean water and dry. 

To Color Gold. — Gilt objects are im- 
proved by boiling in the following solu 
tion: Saltpeter, 2 parts by weight; cook- 
ing salt, 1 part by weight: alum, 1 part 
by weight; water, 24 parts by weight; 
hydrochloric acid, 1 part by weight (1.12 
specific gravity). In order to impart a 
rich appearance to gilt articles, the fol- 
lowing paste is applied: Alum, 3 parts by 
weight; saltpeter, 2 parts by weight; 
zinc vitriol, 1 part by weight; cooking 
salt, 1 part by weight; made into a paste 
with water. Next, heat until black, on 
a hot iron plate, wash with water, scratch 
■with vinegar and dry after washing. 

Gold-Leaf Striping.— To secure a good 
job of gilding depends largely for its 
beauty upon the sizing. Take tube 
chrome yellow ground in oil, thin with 
wearing body varnish, and temper it 
ready for use with turpentine. Apply 
in the evening with an ox-tail striper, and 
let it stand until the next morning, when, 
under ordinary circumstances, it will be 
ready for the gold leaf, etc. After the 
gilding is done, let the job stand 24 
hours before varnishing.

posited on its surface. 

To Burnish Gilt Work. — Ale lias 
proved a very good substitute for soap 
and water in burnishing gilt as it in- 
creases the ease aud smoothness with 
which it is accomplished. Vinegar is a 
somewhat poorer substitute for ale. 

White-Gold Plates Without Solder,— 
The gold serving as a background^ for 
white-gold is rolled in the desired 
dimensions and then made perfectly 
even under a powerful press. It is then 
carefully treated with a file until a per- 
fectly smooth surface is obtained. After 
a white-gold plate of the required thick- 
ness has been produced in the same 
manner, the surfaces of the two plates 
to be united are coated with borax and 
then pressed together by machine, which 
causes the harder metal to be squeezed 
slightly into the surface of the other, 
furnishing a more solid and compact 
mass. The metals, now partially united, 
are firmly fastened together by means of 
strong iron wire and a little more borax 
solution is put on the edges. Then heat 
to the temperature necessary for a com- 
plete adhesion, but the heat must not be 
so great as to cause an alloyage by fusing. 
The whole is finally rolled out into the 
required thickness. 

To Fuse Gold Dust— Use such a 
crucible as is generally used for melting 
brass; heat very hot; then add the gold 
dust mixed with powdered borax; after 
some time a scum or slag will be on top 
which may be thickened by the addition 
or a little lime or bone ash. If the dust 
contains any of the more oxidizable 
metals, add a little niter, and skim off 
the slag or scum very carefully; when 
melted, grasp the crucible with strong 
iron tongs, and pour off immediately 
into molds slightly greased. The slag 
and crucibles may be afterwards pulver- 
ized, and the auriferous matter recovered

GRAIK. 

Formalin Treatment of Seed Grain 
for Smut. — Smut is a parasitic fungus, 
and springs from a spore (which cor- 
responds to a seed in higher plants). 
This germinates when the grain is 
seeded and, penetrating the little grain 
plant when but a few days old, grows up 
within the grain stem. After entering 
the stem there is no evidence of its 
presence until the grain begins to head. 
At this time the smut plant robs the 
developing kernels of their nourishment 
and ripens a mass of smut spores. 

These spores usually ripen before tJie 
grain, and are blown about the neld. 
many spores becoming lodged on tn 
ripening grain kernels. The whotesai 
agent of infection is Hie &rewg* 
machine. For this reason the f dieh 
plan is to treat all seed wheat and oais 
each year. . t 

Secure a 40 per cent solution ^ 
formalin (the commercial name 
formaldehyde gas held in a water 
lution). About 1 ounce is requ' re d , 
every 5 bushels of grain to be treats

to moisten the gram thoroughly. Sprinkle 
stir the grain up thoroughly and sprinkle 
acain, until every kernel is wet. _ . 

\fter sprinkling, place the gram m 
a conical pile and cover with horse- 
blankets, gunny sacks, etc. A he smut 
that does the damage lies just under the 
el nine of the oats or on the basal hairs 
of the wheat. Covering the treated gram 
holds the gas from the formalin nmtkzn 
the pile, where it comes m contact with 
the kernels, killing such smut spores as 
may have survived the previous treat- 
ment. After the grain has remained m a 
covered pile 2 to 4 hours, spread it out 
again where the wind can blow over it, 
to air and dry. # 

As soon as the grain can be taken m 
the hand without the kernels st«J in g 
together, it can be sown in the field. 
The grain may be treated in the forenoon 
and seeded in the afternoon. 

Since this treatment swells the kernels 
it hastens germination and should be 
done in the spring just before seeding 
time. 

While the copper sulphate or blue- 
stnne treatment is valuable in killing 
smut, the formalin treatment can be 
given in less time, is applied so easily 
and is so effectual that it is recommended 
as a sure and ready means of killing 
smut in wheat and oats. 

GRAPE JUICE: 

This recipe has an excellent flavor and 
a good color. Place 1 pint of grapes, 
picked from the stem, in a hot sterilized 
quart jar. Add one cupful of sugar and

GRAVEL WALKS. 

For cleaning gravel walks any of the 
following may be used : I. — Gas-tar 
liquor. 

II. — Rock salt (cattle salt). 

III. — Hydrochloric acid. 

IV. — Sulphuric acid. 

V. — Fresh Hmewater. The. gas -tar 
liquor must be poured out a few times 
in succession, and must not touch the 
tree roots and borders of the paths. This 
medium is cheap. Cattle salt must like- 
wise be thrown out repeatedly. The use 
of hydrochloric and sulphuric acids is 
somewhat expensive. Mix 60 parts of 
water with 10 parts of unslaked lime and 
1 part of sulphuric acid in a kettle, and 
sprinkle the hot or cold mixture on the 
walks by means of a watering pot. If 
limewater is used alone it must be fresh

GRINDSTONES: 

To Mend Grindstones^ — The mending 
of defective places in grindstones is best 
done with a mass consisting of earth- 
wax (so-called stone-pitch), 5 parts, by 
weight; tar, 1 part; and powdered sand- 
stone or cement, 3 parts, which is heated 
to the boiling point and well stirred to- 
gether. Before pouring in the mass the 

I places to be mended must be heated by 
aying red-hot pieces of iron on them. 
The substance is, in a tough state, poured 
into the hollows of the stone, and the 
pouring must be continued, when it com- 
mences to solidify, until even with the 
surface. 

Treatment of the Grindstone. — The 
stone^should not be left with the lower 

Eart in the water. This will render it 
nttle at this spot, causing it to wear off 
more quickly and thus lose its circu- 
larity. It is best to moisten the stone 
only when in use, drop by drop from a 
vessel fixed above it and to keep it quite 
dry otherwise. If the stone is no longer 
round, it should be made so again by 
turning by means of a piece of gas pipe or 
careful trimming, otherwise it will com- 
mence to jump, thus becoming useless, 
it is important to clean all tools and 
articles before grinding, carefully re- 
movmg a ]l g^e, f atj etc., as the pores 
of the stone become clogged with these 
impurities, which destroy its grain and 
diminish its strength. Should one side

GUNPOWDER STAINS. 

A stain produced by the embedding 
of grains of gunpowder in the skin is 
practically the same thing as a tattoo 
mark. The charcoal of the gunpowder 
remains unaffected by the fluids of the 
tissues, and no way is known of bring- 
ing it into solution there. The only 
method of obliterating such marks as 
to take away with them the skin m 
which they are embedded. This has 
been accomplished by the application 
of an electric current, and by the use 
of caustics. When the destruction of 
the true skin has been accomplished, 
it becomes a foreign body, and if the 
destruction has extended to a sufficient 
depth, the other foreign body, the color- 
ing matter which has been tattooed in, 
may be expected to be cast off with it. 

Recently pepsin and papain have been 
proposed as applications to remove the 
cuticle A glycerole of either is tattooed 



into the skin over the disfigured part 
and it is said that the operation ha 
proved successful. 

It is scarcely necessary to say tha 
suppuration, is likely to follow such trea 
ment, and that there is risk of scarrin 
In view of this it becomes apparent th 
any such operation should be under 
taken only by a surgeon skilled in 
dermatological practice. An amateur 
might not only cause the patient suffer- 
ing without success in removal, but add 
another disfigurement to the tattooing. 

Carbolic acid has been applied to 
small portions of the affected area at a 
time, with the result that the powder and 
skin were removed simultaneously and, 
according to the physician reporting the 
case, with little discomfort to the patient. 

Rubbing the affected part with 
moistened ammonium chloride once or 
twice a day has been reported as a slow 
but sure cure.

and pieces are very liable to be broken 
off. Various methods have been tried, 
with a view to removing this defect and 
increasing the hardness of gypsum. Of 
these methods, that of Wachsmuth, for 
hardening articles made of gypsum and 
rendering them weather-proof, deserves 
special notice. All methods of hardening 
articles made of gypsum have this in 
common: the gypsum is first deprived of 
its moisture, and then immersed in a 
solution of certain salts, such as alum, 
green vitriol, etc. Articles treated by 
the methods hitherto in vogue certainly 
acquire considerable hardness, but are 
no more capable of resistance to the 
effects of water than crude gypsum. 
The object of Wachsmuth' s process is 
not merely to harden the gypsum, but to 
transform it on the surface into insoluble 
combinations. The process is as fol- 
ows: The article is first put into the re- 
quired shape by mechanical means, and 
then deprived of its moisture by heating 
to to 302° F. It is then plunged 

nto a heated solution of barium hydrate, 
in which it is allowed to remain for a 
onger or shorter time, according to its 
strength. When this part of the process 
is complete, the article is smoothed by 
grinding, etc., and then placed in a solu- 
tion of about 10 per cent of oxalic acid 
"n water. In a few hours it is taken out, 
dried, and polished. It then possesses 
a hardness surpassing that of marble, 
and is impervious to the action of water, 
^or does the polish sustain any injury 
'ram contact with water, whereas gypsum 
trticles hardened by the usual methods 
ose their polish after a few minutes' 
immersion in water. Articles treated by 
the method described have the natural 

jj 1 " of pP sum > but it is possible to 
idd a color to the gypsum during the 
lardenmg process. This is done by 
Munging the gypsum, after it has been 
deprived of its moisture, and before the 
"reatment with the barium solution, 
nto a solution of a colored metallic 
ulphate, such as iron, copper, or chrome 
ulphate, or into a solution of some 
a? f in £ ma tter. Pigments soluble in 
the barium or oxatic-acid solutions may 
mso be added to the latter. 

Gypsum may be hardened and 
rendered insoluble by ammonium borate 
as follows : Dissolve boric acid in hot 
water and add sufficient ammonia water 
to the solution that the borate at first 
separated is redissolved. The gypsum 
to be cast is stirred in with this liquid, 
and the mass treated in the ordinary 
Way Articles already cast are simply 
washed with the liquid, which is quickly

HAIR FOR MOUNTING. 

The microscopist or amateur w b„ 
ayes himself, need never resort to tie 



sh 



trouble of embedding and cutting hair, 
in the microtome in order to secure verv 
thin sections of the hair of the face it 
he will first shave himself closely "with 
the hair," as the barbers say (i. e., inthe 
direction of the natural growth 'of the 
hair) and afterwards lightly "against 
the hair (in the opposite direction to 
above), he will find in the "scrapings" 
a multitude of exceedingly thin sections. 
The technique is very simple. The lather 
and "scrapings" are put into a saucer or 
large watch-glass and carefully washed 
with clean water. This breaks down 
and dissolves the lather, leaving the hair 
sections lying on the bottom of the glass. 
The after-treatment is that usually em- 
ployed in mounting similar objects.

DANDRUFF CURES. 

The treatment of that condition of the 
scalp which is productive of dandruff 
properly falls to the physician, but un- 
fortunately the subject has not been much 
studied. One cure is said to be a sulphur 
lotion made by placing a little sublimed 
sulphur in water, shaking well, then al- 
lowing to settle, and washing the head 
every morning with the clear liquid. 

Sulphur is said to be insoluble m 
water; yet a sulphur water made as 
above indicated has long been in use as a 
hair wash. A little glycerine improves 
the preparation, preventing the hair 
from becoming harsh by repeated wash- 
ings. 

The exfoliated particles of skin or 
"scales" should be removed only when 
entirely detached from the cuticle. J hey 
result from an irritation which is in ~ 
creased by forcible removal, and 
endeavors to clean the hair from them 
by combing or brushing it in such a way 
as to scrape the scalp are liahle to 
worse than useless. It follows tna' 
gentle handling of the hair is important 
when dandruff is present.

Dissolve the salts in the water and add

precipitate is all redissolved. This solu- 
tion, properly applied, is said to produce 
a very black color; a lighter shade is 
secured by diluting the solution. Cop- 
per sulphate may be used instead of the 
nitrate. 

Erown Hair Dyes. — A large excess of 
ammonia tends to produce a brownish 
dye. Various shades of brown may be 
produced by increasing the amount of 
water in the silver solution. It should 
be remembered that the hair must, pre- 
viously to treatment, be washed with warm 
water containing sodium carbonate, well 
rinsed with clear water, and dried.

HAIR RESTORERS AND TONICS: 

Falling of the Hair.— After the scalp 
has been thoroughly cleansed by the 
shampoo, the following formula is to be 
used: 

Salicylic acid 1 P art 

Precipitate of sulphur. 2i parts 

Rose water 25 parts 

The patient is directed to part the hair, 



and then to rub in a small portion of the 
ointment along the part, working it well 
into the scalp. Then another part is 
made parallel to the first, and more oint- 
ment rubbed in. Thus a series of first, 
longitudinal, and then transverse parts 
are made, until the whole scalp has Deen 
well anointed. Done in this way, it is 
not necessary to smear up the whole 
shaft of the hair, but only to reach the 
hair roots and the sebaceous glands, 
where the trouble is located. This proc- 
ess is thoroughly performed for six suc- 
cessive nights, and the seventh night an- 
other uhampoo is taken. The eighth 
night the inunctions are commenced 
again, and this is continued for six weeks. 
In almost every case the production of 
dandruff is checked completely after six 
weeks' treatment, and the hair, which 
may have been falling out rapidly before, 
begins to take firmer root. To be sure, 
many hairs which are on the point of 
falling when treatment is begun will fall 
anyway, and it may even seem for a time 
as if the treatment were increasing the 
hair-fall, on account of the mechanical 
dislodgment of such hairs, but this need 
never alarm one. 

After six weeks of such treatment tne 
shampoo may be taken less frequently. 

Next to dandruff, perhaps, the most 
common cause of early loss of hair is 
heredity. In some families all ot tne 
male members, or all who resemble one 
particular ancestor, lose their hair early. 
Dark-haired families and races, as a 
rule .become bald earlier than those with 
Hiht hair. At first thought it would 
sfem as though nothing could be don ,e to 
Br event premature baldness when hered 
fty is the cause, but this ia a mistake^

counte balance hereditary ' P^P.?^

J on is Lepage'^ fish glue, but a mixture 
of K ue a P nd g paste, with carbolic acid

the under surface of the leaf, and some 
of the flowers and seeds placed loose m

Sips of gummed stiff but thm paper such 
as very thm parchment paper These 
strips are either gummed over the stems 
etc .and pinched in round the stem with 
forceps, or passed through slits made 
in the sheet and fastened at the back.

and protected in glass frames, stitching 
in the principal parts with gray thread 
produces a very satisfactory appearance. 

Hectograph Pads and Inks 

The hectograph is a gelatin pad used 
for duplicating letters, etc., by transfer. 
The pad should have a tough elastic 
consistency, similar to that of a printer s 
roller. The letter or sketch to be dupli- 
cated is written or traced on a sheet ot 
heavy paper with an aniline ink (allien, 
has great tinctorial qualities). When 
dry tnis is laid, inked side down, on 
the pad and subjected to moderate and 
uniform pressure for a few minutes. It 
may then be removed, when a copy ot 
the original will be found on the pad 
which has absorbed a large quantity ot 
the ink. The blank sheets are laid one 
by one on the pad, subjected to moderate 
pressure over the whole surface witn a 
wooden or rubber roller, or with the 
hand, and lifted off by taking hold or 
the corners and stripping them gently 
with an even movement. If this is done 
too quicklv the composition may be torn. 
Each succeeding copy thus made will 



be a little fainter than its predecessor 
From 40 to GO legible copies may b 
made. When the operation is finishes, 
the surface of the pad should be gone 
over gently with a wet sponge and the 
remaining ink soaked out. The super- 
fluous moisture is then carefully wiped 
off, when the pad will be ready for 
another operation. 

The pad or hectograph is essentially 
a mixture of glue (gelatin) and glycerine. 
This mixture has the property of remain- 
ing soft yet firm for a long time and of 
absorbing and holding certain^ coloring 
matters in such a way as to give them 
up slowly or in layers, so to speak, on 
pressure. 

Such a pad may be made by melting 
together 1 part of glue, 2 parts of water 
and 4 parts of glycerine (all by weight, 
of course), evaporating some of the water 
and tempering the mixture with more 
glue or glycerine if the season or climate 
require. The mass when of proper con- 
sistency, which can be ascertained by 
cooling a small portion, is poured into a 
shallow pan and allowed to set. V le *? 
glue must be used or the mixture strained; 
and air bubbles should be removed by 
skimming the surface with a piece of 
eard-board or similar appliance.

with an aqueous solution of potassium 
ferroeyanide, drying them, and then 
treating with a hot dilute solution ot 
copper sulphate. A black stain can be 
produced in the following manner: 

After having finely sandpapered the 
horns, dissolve 50 to 60 grains of nitrate 
of silver in 1 ounce of distilled water. .It 
will be colorless. Dip a small brush in, 
and paint the horns wTiere they are to be 
black. When dry, put them where ^ the

How to Lay Galvanized Iron Roofing. 

The use of galvanized iron for general 

roofing work has increased greatly dur- 
ing the past few years. It has many 
features which commend it as a roofing 
material, but difficulties have been ex- 
perienced by beginners as to the proper 
method of applying it to the roof, the 
weight of material used is rather heavy 
to permit of double seaming, but a meth- 
od has been evolved that is satisfac- 
tory. Galvanized iron roofing can be 
put on at low cost, so as to be water-taght 
Ld free from buckling at the nomto. 
The method does away with double 
seaming, and is considered more suitable 
than tne latter for roofing JFJP«£

ition consists in turning a strip 1 inch 
vide toward the sheet, as shown in big. 2. 
This sheet is then laid on the roof, and a 
leat about 8 inches long and 1 inch 
ride, made of galvanized iron, is nailed 
,j the roof close to the sheet and bent 
)ver it, as shown in Fig. 3. 
A second sheet having li inches 
imed up is now brought against the 
rst sheet and bent over both sheet and 
Jeat, as shown in Fig. 4. The cleat is 
then bent backward over the second 
sheet and cut off eir-e to the roof, as in 
Fig, 5, after wh><"b the seams are drawn 
together by double seaming tools, as the 
occasion aemands, an d slightly ham- 
mered with a wooden mallet. Ths fin- 
ished seam is showD in Fig. 6. It will 
be seen that + he second sheet of galvan- 
ized iron, cut | inch '-jnger tnan the first, 
laps over the ;ormer, making a sort of 
bead which prevents water from driving 
in. Cleats hold both sheets firmly to the 
roof and are nailed about 12 inches 
apart. Roofs of this character, when 
laid with No. 28 gauge iron, cost very 
little more than the cheaper grades of 
tin, and do not have to be painted. 

Applications for Prickly Heat.— Many 
applications for this extremely annoying 
form of urticaria have been suggested 
and their efficacy strongly urged by the 
various correspondents of the medical 
press who propose them, but none of 
them seem to be generally efficacious. 
Ihus, sodium bicarbonate in strong 
aqueous solution, has long been a domes- 
tic remedy in general use, but it fails 
probably as often as it succeeds. A 
weak solution of copper sulphate has 
also been highly extolled, only to disap-

How to Keep Lamp Burners in Order. 
—In the combustion of coal oil a car- 
bonaceous residue is left, which attaches 
itself very firmly to the metal along the 
edge of the burner next the flame. 1 his 
is especially true of round burners, 
where the heat of the flame is more in- 
tense than in flat ones, and the deposit ot 
carbon, where not frequently removed, 
soon gets sufficiently heavy to interfere 
seriously with the movements the wick 
up or down. The deposit may be 
scraped off with a knife blade, but a 
much more satisfactory process of get- 
ting rid of it is as follows: Dissolve so- 
dium carbonate, 1 part, m 5 or 6 parts of 
water, and in this boil the burner for 5 



minutes or so. "When taken out the 
burner will look like a new one, and acta 
like one, provided that the apparatus

To Remove the Odor from Pasteboard. 

— Draw the pasteboard through a 3 per

To Remove Woody Odor — To get rid 
cf that frequently disagreeable smell in 
old chests, drawers, etc., paint the sur- 
face over with the following mixture: 

Acetic ether 100 parts 

Formaldehyde 6 parts 

Acid, carbolic 4 parts

How to Make a Cellar "Waterproof. — 
The old wall surface should be roughened 
and perfectly cleaned before plastering 
is commenced. It may be advisable to 
put the first coat on not thicker than J 
inch, and after this has set it may be 
cut and roughened by a pointing trowel. 
Then apply a second |-inch coat and 
finish this to an even and smooth sur- 
face. Proportion of plaster: One-half 
part slaked lime, 1 part Portland ce- 
ment, part fine, sharp sand, to be mixed 
well and applied instantly. 

Removing Old Wall Paper. --Some 
paper hangers remove old paper from 
walls by first dampening it with water in 
which a little baking soda has been dis- 
solved, the surface being then gone over 
with a "scraper" or other tool. How- 
over, the principle object of any method 
is to soften the old paste. This may be 
readdy accomplished by first wetting a 
section of the old paper with cold or 
tepid water, using a brush, repeating the 
wetting until the paper and paste are 
soaked through, when the paper mav 
easily be pulled off, or, if too tender, ma"v 
be scraped with any instrument of a 
chisel form shoved between the paper 
and the wa 1. The wall should then be 
washed with clean water, this operation 
being materially assisted by wetting the 
wall ahead of the washing.

Treatment 



of 



Damp Walls. _j 

t. ' 

which i s 



good and simple remedy to obviatt*+t£ 
evil is caoutchouc glue ■ ™U 



1 walls to 



pared from rubber hose 
te laid dry are first to be thorough! 
cleaned by brushing and rubbinc S 
then the caoutchouc size, which has b 
previously made liquid by heating i s !2 
plied with a broad brush in a uniform 
layer about 8 to 12 inches higher than 
the wall appears damp— and finally 
paper is pasted over the glue when the 
latter is still sticky. The paper will at 
once adhere very firmly. Or else, apply 
the liquefied glue in a uniform layer 
upon paper (wall paper, caoutchouc paper, 
etc.)- Upon this, size paint may be ap- 
plied, or it may be covered with wall 
paper or plaster. 

If the caoutchouc size is put on with 
the necessary care— i. e., if all damp 
spots are covered with it — the wall is 
laid dry for the future, and no peeling off 
of the paint or the wall paper needs to be 
apprehended. In cellars, protection 
from dampness can be had in a like 
manner, as the caoutchouc glue adheres 
equally well to all surfaces, whether 
stone, glass, metal, or wood. 

II. — The walls must be well cleaned 
before painting. If the plaster should 
be worn and permeated with saltpeter 
in places it should be renewed and 
smoothed. These clean surfaces are 
coated twice with a water-glass solution, 
1.1, using a brush ana allowed to thy 
well. Then they are painted 3 tunes 
with the following mixture: Dissolve 
100 parts, by weight, of mastic in JJ

ficial effects to be observed in the use 
of most preparations we must place the 
following bid effects: The great smooth- 
ness and slipperiness of the boards dur- 
ing the first few days after every appli- 
cation of the dressing, which forbids the 
use of the latter on steps, floors of gymna- 
sia, dancing floors, etc. The fact that 
the oil or grease penetrates the soles ot 
the boots or shoes, the hems of ladies 
dresses, and things accidentally falling 
to the floor are soiled and spotted, lie- 
sides these there is, especially during the 
first few days after application, the dirty 
dark coloration which the boards take 
on after protracted use of the oils. 
Finally, there is the considerable cost ot 
any process, especially for smaller rooms 
and apartments. In schoolrooms and 
railroad waiting rooms and other places 
much frequented by children and others 
wearing shoes set with iron, the boards 
soon become smooth from wear, and tor 
such places the process is not suited 

According to other sources ot mlor- 
mation, these evil tendencies of the appli- 
cation vanish altogether, or are reduced 
to a minimum, if (1) entirely fresh or at 
least, not rancid oils be used; (3) if, after 
each oiling, a few days be allowed to 
elapse before using the chamber or hall, 
and finally (3), if report is not had to 



costly foreign special preparations, but 
German goods, procurable at wholesale 
in any quantity, and at very low figures. 

The last advice (to use low-priced 
preparations) seems sensible since accord- 
ing to recent experiments, none of the 
oils expci mented upon possess any es- 
pecial adi mtages over the others. 

An overwhelming majority of the 
laboratories for examination have given 
a verdict in favor of oil as a dust-sup- 
pressing a pplication for floors, and have 
expressed a desire to see it in universal 
use. The. following is a suggestion put 
forth for the use of various preparations: 
This di st-absorbing agent has for its 
object to cake up the dust in sweeping 
floors, etc., and to prevent its develop- 
ment. The production is as follows: 
Mix in an intimate manner 12 parts, by 
weight, of mineral sperm oil with 88 
parts, by weight, of Roman or Portland 
cement, adding a few drops of mirbane 
oil Upon stirring a uniform paste forma 
at first, which then passes into a greasy 
sandy mass. This mass is sprinkled 
upon the surface to be swept and cleaned 
of dust, next going over it with a broom 
or similar object in the customary man- 
ner, at which operation the dust will 
m?x with the mass. The preparation 
can be used repeatedly. 
HOW TO FLUFF THE HAIR: 



Hair can be fluffed and made tostanj 
nut well from the head, even without 
Sriin? by brushing it with an outward 
r^ist^lf the wrist that lifts the hair up 
SS&Sjp. For this brushing divide 
the hair into strands and go °ver tne 
£ e ad b m r a circle ^ 
and continue until all the hair n» 
lifted and lightene^ If this J tge^ 

brushing is kept ^P^^^t and 
times a week, the Ht ™ s an - 
stringiest of hair soon becomes urj 
easy to puff out from the face.

Make a % per cent solution of the best

flood the filtrate over any surface which 
it is desired to ornament. Drain off 
slightly, and if the weather is sufficiently 
cold, put the plate, as nearly level as pos- 
sible, out into the cold air to freeze. In 
freezing, water is abstracted from the 
colloidal portion, which latter then as- 
sumes an efflorescent form, little flowers, 
with exuberant, graceful curves of crys- 
tals, showing up as foliage, from all over 
the surface. To preserve in permanent 
form all that is necessary is to flood them 
with absolute alcohol. This treatment 
removes the ice, thus leaving a lasting 
framework of gelatin which may be 
preserved indefinitely. In order to do 
this, as soon as the gelatin has become 
quite dry it should be either varnished,

DRAWING INKS: 

Blue Ru l ing Ink. — Good vitriol, 
ounces; indigo, 1 ounce. Pulverize th 
indigo, add it to the vitriol, and let i 
stand exposed to the air for S days, o 
until dissolved; then fill the pots wit 
chalk, add fresh gall, £ gill, boiling i 
before use. 

Black Ruling Ink. — Take good black 
ink, and add gall as for blue. Do not 
cork it, as this prevents it from turning 
black. 

Carbon Ink. — Dissolve real India ink 
in common black ink, or add a small 
quantity of lampblack previously heated 
to redness, and ground perfectly smooth, 
with a small portion of the ink. 

Carmine.— The ordinary solution of 
carmine in ammonia water, after a short 
time in contact with steel, becomes black- 
ish red, but an ink may be made that 
will retain its brilliant carmine color to 
the last by the following process, given by 
Dingier: Triturate 1 part of pure car- 
mine with 15 parts of acetate of ammonia 
solution, with an equal quantity of dis- 
tilled water in a porcelain mortar, and 
allow the whole to stand for some time. 
In this way, a portion of the alumina, 
which is combined with the carmine dye, 
is taken up by the acetic acid of the am- 
m onk sal?, a'nd separates as a precipi- 
tate, while the pure .hlhlu 
cochineal remains dissolved in the half-

and II are the most widely known 

T —In 500 parts of water dissolve 36 
narts of sodium fluoride and 7 parts ot 
fodium sulphate. In another^ vessel 



dissolve in the same amount of water 14 
oarts of zinc chloride and to the solution 
add 56 parts of concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid. To use, mix equal vol- 
umes of the two solutions and add a little 
India ink; or, in the absence of this, rub 
up a little lampblack with it. It is 
scarcely necessary to say thaf the mix- 
ture should not be put in glass containers, 
unless they are well coated internally 
with paramne, wax gutta-percha or 
some similar material. To avoid the 
inconvenience of keeping the solutions m 
separate bottles, mix them and preserve 
in a rubber bottle. A quill pen is best to 
use in writing with this preparation, but 
metallic pens may be used, if quite clean 
and new. 

II. — In 150 parts of alcohol dissolve 
20 parts of rosin, and add to this, drop 
by drop, stirring continuously, a solution 
of 35 parts of borax in 250 parts of water. 
This being accomplished, dissolve in the 
solution sufficient methylene blue to give 
it the desired tint. 

Ink for Writing on Glazed Cardboard, 
— The following are especially recom- 
mended for use on celluloid: 

I. — Dissolve 4 drachms of brown 
shellac in 4 ounces of alcohol. Dissolve 
7 drachms of borax in 6 ounces of dis- 
tilled water. Pour the first solution 
slowly into the second and carefully mix 
them, after which add 12 grains of 
aniline dye of the desired color. Violet, 
blue, green, red, yellow, orange, or 
black aniline dyes can be used. 

Such inks may be used for writing on 
bottles, and the glass may be cleaned 
with water without the inscription being 
impaired. 

II.— Ferric chloride .... 10 parts 

Tannin is par t s 

Acetone 1Q0 parts

ing glass. Any color may be mixed with 
the chalky If the glass is thoroughly 
cleaned with alcohol or ether, either a 
quill pen or a camel's-hair pencil (or a 
fresh, clean steel pen) may be used. 

Ink on Marble. — Ink marks on marble 
may be removed with a paste made by 
dissolving an ounce of oxalic acid and 
half an ounce of butter of antimony in % 
pint of rain water, and adding sufficient 
flour to form a thin paste. Apply this to 
the stains witli a brush; allow it to re- 
main on 3 or 4 days and then wash it off. 
Make a second application, if necessary.

GOLD INK. 

I —The best gold ink is made by rub- 
bing up gold leaf as thoroughly as pos- 
sible with a little honey. The honey is 
then washed away with water, and the 
finely powdered gold leaf left is mixed to 
the consistency of a writing ink with weak 
gum water. Everything depends upon 
the fineness of the gold powder, 1. e., 
upon the diligence with which it has been 
worked with the honey. Precipitated 
sold is finer than can be got by any rub- 
bing, but its color is wrong, being dark 
brown. The above gold ink should be 
used with a quill pen. 

jj — An imitation gold or bronze ink 
is composed by grinding 1,000 parts of 
powdered bronze of handsome color 
with a varnish prepared by boiling to- 
gether 500 parts of nut oil, 200 parts ot 
garlic, 500 parts of cocoanutoil, 100 parts 
of Naples yellow, and as much of sienna.

quill to write on zinc labels. It almost 
immediately turns black, and cannot be 



removed by washing. The addition of 
gum and lampblack, as recommended i 
certain books, is unnecessary, and eve 
prejudicial to the quality of the ink. 

II. — Verdigris and sal ammoniac, 
each ^ ounce- levigated lampblack,

zinc, iron, or steel. 

III. - — Blue vitriol, 1 ounce; sal a

black or vermilion may be added,_ b 
it is not necessary. Use No. I, for iro 
tin, or steel plate. 

INDELIBLE INKS. 

These are also frequently called water- 
proof, incorrodible, or indestructible 
inks. They are employed for writing 
labels on bottles containing strong acids 
and alkaline solutions. They may be 
employed with stamps, types or stencil 
plates, by which greater neatness will be 
secured than can be obtained with either 
a brush or pen.

Blue Indelible Ink.— This ink has the 
reputation of resisting not only water 
and oil, but alcohol, oxalic acid, alkalies, 
the chlorides, etc. It is prepared as fol- 
lows: Dissolve 4 parts of gum lac in 6b 
parts of boiling water carrying 2 parts 
of borax. Filter and set aside. -Now 
dissolve 2 parts of gum arabic in 4 parts 
of water and add the solution to the 
filtrate. Finally, after the solution is 
quite cold, add 2 parts of powdered 
indigo and dissolve by agitation. Let 
stand for several hours, then decant, and 
put in small bottles. 

Red Indelible Inks.— By proceeding 
according to the following formula, an 
intense purple-red color may be pro- 
duced on fabrics, which is indelible m 
the customary sense of the word: 

1. — Sodium carbonate . . 3 drachms 

Gum arabic. 3 drachms 

Water 12 drachms 

g. — Platinic chloride 1 drachm 

Distilled water 2 ounces 

3. — Stannous chloride. . . 1 drachm 
Distilled water 4 drachms 

Moisten the place to be written upon 
with No. 1 and rub a warm iron over it 
until dry; then write with No. 2, ana, 
when dry, moisten with No. 3. An 
intense and beautiful purple-red color is 
porduced in this way. A very rich 
purple color — the purple of Cassiiis-^ -- 
may be produced by substituting a solu- 
tion oE gold chloride for the platinic 
chloride in the above formula. 

Crimson Indelible Ink. — 

The following formula makes an indelible 
crimson ink: 

Silver nitrate 50 parts 

Sodium carbonate,

INDIA, CHINA, OR JAPAN INK. 

Ink by these names is based on lamp- 
black, and prepared in various ways. 
Many makes flow less easily from the 
pen than other inks, and are less durable 
than ink that writes paler and afterwards 
turns black. The ink is usually unfitted 
for steel pens, but applies well with a 
brush. 

I. — Lampblack (finest) is , ground 
to a paste with very weak liquor oi 
potassa, and this paste is then ohfiusal 
through water slightly alkalized witii p-

LITHOGRAPHIC INKS. 

These are for writing on lithographic 
stones or plates: 

I — Mastie (in tears), 8 ounces; shel- 
lac, 12 ounces; Venice turpentine, 1 
ounce. Melt together, add wax, 1 
pound; tallow, 6 ounces. When dis- 
solved, add hard tallow soap (m _ shav- 
ings), 6 ounces; and when the whole is 
perfectly combined, add lampblack 4 
ounces. Mix well, cool a little. «nd then 



pour it into molds, or upon a slab, and 
when cold cut it into square pieces. 

II. (Lasteyrie). — Dry tallow soap, 
mastic (in tears), and common soda (in 
fine powder), of each, 30 parts; shellac, 
150 parts; lampblack, IS parts. Mix as

MARKING OR LABELING INKS: 
Black Marking Inks. — 

I. — Borax 60 parts 

Shellac 180 parts 

Boiling water 1,000 parts 

Lampblack, a sufficient quantity. 
Dissolve the borax in the water, add 
the shellac to the solution and stir until 
dissolved. Rub up a little lampblack 
with sufficient of the liquid to form a 
paste, and add the rest of the solution a 
little at a time and with constant rubbing. 
Test, and if not black enough, repeat the 
operation. To get the best effect— a 
pure jet-black— the lampblack should b 
purified and freed from the calcium 
phosphate always present m the com 
mercial article to the extent, frequently, 
of 85 to 87 per cent, by treating wrt 
hydrochloric acid and washing wi 
water. 

II.— An ink that nothing will bleach l 
made by mixing pyrogallic acid and sal 
phate of iron in equal parts. Particu 
farly useful for marking labels on bottle 
containing acids. Varnish the labe 
after the Ink is dry so that moisture w 
not affect it.
