Powdered Cork as a Preservative.— 
Tests have shown that Peered cork is 
in* efficacious for packing and me- 
Jerving fruits and vegetables. A bed of 
corkl p aced at the Worn of the case 
and the fruits or vegetables and the cork 
are then disposed in alternate layers, 
with a final one of cork at the top. Care 
should be taken to fill up the interstices, 
in order to prevent friction. Fruit may 
thus be kept fresh a year, provided any 
unsound parts have been removed pre- 
liminarily. When unpacking for sale, 
it suffices to plunge the fruit into water. 
Generally speaking, 50 pounds of cork go 
with 1,000 or 1,200 pounds of fruit. The 
cork serves as a protection against cold, 
heat, and humidity. Various fruits, 
such as grapes, mandarines, tomatoes, 
and early vegetables, are successfully 
packed in this way. 

Petrifying Wooden Objects.— 
Take equal parts of Rock Salt or Table 
Salt, Hock Alum (Commercial Lump 
Alum), White Vinegar, Chalk and (pow- 
dered) Pebbles. (You can substitute for 
the latter any kind of coarse quartz 
sand). Mix all together— ebullition will 
ensue. After it has ceased, throw some 
wooden objects into the solution and let 
them soak for five days, at the end of 
which time they will be transformed into 
petrifaction. 

Note: This formula really will not 
petrify the wood, but will cover it with a 
very nice coat of crystals. As the solu- 
tion evaporates, it leaves the crystals on 
the wood which appear as the wood

PUMICE STONE. 

While emery is used for polishing tools 
polishing saud for stones and gl ass ' 
ferric oxide for fine glassware, and liu^ 
and felt for metals, pumice stone is more 
frequently employed for polishing softer 
objects. Natural pumice stone p re . 
sents but little firmness, and the search 
has therefore been made to replace the 
natural product with an artificial one. 
An artificial stone has been produced hy 
means of sandstone and clay, designed to 
be used for a variety of purposes. No. 1 ( 
hard or soft, with coarse grain, is 
designed for leather and waterproof 
garments, and for the industries of felt 
and wool; No. 2, hard and soft, of aver- 
age grain, is designed for work in stucco 
and sculptors' use, and for ruhbing down 
wood before painting; No. 3, soft, with 
fine grain, is used for polishing wood and 
tin articles; No. 4, of average hardness, 
with fine grain, is used for giving to wood 
a surface previous to polishing with oil; 
No. 5, hard, with fine grain, is employed 
for metal work and stones, especially 
lithographic stones. These artificial 
products are utilized in the same manaer 
as the volcanic products. For giving a 
smooth surface to wood, the operation is 
dry; but for finishing, the product is 
diluted with oil.

likewise resists most acids. 

Black Putty. — Mix whiting and an- 
timony sulphide, the latter finely pow- 
dered, with soluble glass. This putty, it 
is claimed, can be polished, after harden- 
ing, by means of a burnishing agate. 

Durable Putty. — According to the 
"Gewerbeschau," mix a handful of burnt 
lime with 4} ounces of linseed oil; allow 
this mixture to boil down to the consist- 
ency of common putty, and dry the ex- 
tensible mass received, in a place not 
accessible to the rays of the sun. When 
the putty, which has become very hard 
through the drying, is to be used, it is 
warmed. Over the flame it will become 
soft and pliable, but after having been 
applied and become cold, it binds the 
various materials very firmly. 

Glaziers' Putty. — I. — For puttying 
panes or looking glasses into picture 
frames a mixture prepared as follows is 
well adapted: Make a solution of gum 
Mastic in benzine, strong enough so that 
a syrup-like fluid results. If the solu-

, H- — A useful putty for mirrors, etc., 
is prepared by dissolving gummi elasti- 
cum (caoutchouc) in benzol to a syrupy 
solution, and incorporating this 'latter 
with a mixture of white lead and linseed 
oil to make a stiff pulp. The putty 
adheres strongly to both glass and wood, 
and may therefore be applied to the 
framework of the window, mirror, etc., 
to be glazed, the glass being then 
pressed firmly on the cementing layer 
thus formed. 

Hard Putty.— This is used by carriage 

Eainters and jewelers. Boil 4 pounds 
rown umber and 7 pounds linaeed oil 
for 2 hours; stir in 2 ounces beeswax; 
take from the fire and mix in 5^ pounds 
chalk and 11 pounds white lead; the 
mixing must be done very thoroughly. 

Painters' Putty and Rough Stuff. — 
Gradually knead sifted dry chalk (whit- 
ing) or else rye flour, powdered white 
lead, zinc white, or lithopone white with 
good linseed-oil varnish. The best 
putty is produced from varnish with 
plenty of chalk and some zinc white. 
This mixture can be tinted with earth 
colors. These oil putties must be well 
kneaded together and rather compact 
(like glaziers' putty). ' . . 

If flour paste is boiled (this is best 
produced by scalding with hot water, 
pouring in, gradually, the rye flour 
which has been previously dissolved in a 
little cold water and stirring constant^ 
until the proper consistency is attained) 
and dry sifted chalk and a little varnish 
are added, a good rough stuff for wood 
or iron is obtained, which can be rubbed. 
This may also be produced from gla- 
irs' oil putty by gradually kneading into 
it flour pastel/dl little more sifted dry 

chalk.

'Waterproof Patties.— I —Grind pow- 
dered white lead or minium (red lead) 
fftJbk linseed-oil varnjsh to a s ff 
taste. This putty is used extensively 
for tightening wrought-iron gas pipes, 
for tightening 6 rivet seams on gas meter, 
hot-water furnaces, cast-iron flange pipes 
for hot-water heating, etc. 1 he putt} 
made with minium dries very slowlj, but 
becomes tight even before it is quite 
hard, and holds very firmly after solidin- 
eation. Sometimes a little ground gyp- 
sum is added to it. 

The two following putties are cheaper 
than the above-mentioned red lead 
putty: II. — One part white lead, 1 part y 
manganese, one part white pipe clay, j 
prepared with linseed-oil varnish. 

HI. — Two parts red lead, 5 parts 
white lead, 4 parts clay, ground in or 
prepared with linseed-oil varnish. 

IV. — -Excellent putty, which has been 
found invaluable where waterproof 
closing and permanent adhesion are 
desired, is made from litharge and 
glycerine. The litharge must be finely 
pulverized and the glycerine very concen- 
trated, thickly liquid, and clear as water. 
Both substances are mixed into a viscid, 
thickly liquid pulp. The pegs of kero- 
sene lamps, for instance, can be fixed in 
so firmly with this putty that they can only 
be removed by chiseling it out. For put- 
tying in the glass panes of aquariums it

and keep at this temperature Jot 20 
minutes. If the paper is to be "slow," 
it may now be taken out, dried, cut into 
strips, and rolled. If to be "faster,'"' the 
heat is to be continued longer, according 
to the quickness desired. Care must be 
taken to avoid boiling, which might dis- 
integrate the paper. 

In preparing these papers, every pre- 
caution against fire should be taken, and 
their preparation in the shop or house 
should not be thought of. In. malting 
the solutions, etc., where heat is neces- 
sary, the water bath should invariant 
be used.

ments of phosphorus, each the size of a 
pea whicE will qnickly dissolve. Shake 
the liquid, and pour out a small tea- 
spoonful onto a piece of blotting paper. 
The carbon disulphide will quickly evap- 
orate, leaving a film of phosphorus on 
the paper, which will quickly emit fumes 
and burst into flame. The once-popu- 
lar term Fenian fire was derived from 
the supposed use of this liquid by the 
Fenians for the purpose of setting fire to 
houses by throwing a_ bottle down a 
chimney or through a window, the bottle 
to break and its contents to speedily set 
fire to the place. 

For the purpose of experiment this 
liquid should only be prepared in small 
quantities as above, and any left over 
should be poured away onto the soil in 
the open air, so as to obviate the risk of 
fire. Thin paper may be fired in a sim- 
ilar manner with the acid bulbs and 
powder already mentioned. The pow- 
der should be formed into a paste, laid on 
the paper, and allowed to dry. Then the 
"id bulb is pasted over the powder.

mouth quickly; this cuts off the air from 
the flame and it immediately goes out. 
Be careful not to drop the sponge on the 
face or chin. Remove sponge under 
cover of a handkerchief before placing 
the second one in the mouth. 

Burning Sealing Wax. — Take a stick 
of common sealing wax in one hand and 
a candle in the other, melt the wax over 
the candle, and put on your tongue while 
blazing. The moisture of the mouth 
cools it almost instantly. Care should 
be taken not to get any on the lips, chin, 
or hands. 

Demon Bowls of Fire. — The performer 
has three 64-inch brass bowls on a table, 
and openly pours ordinary clean water 
(may be drunk) into bowls ? until each is 
about half full. Then by simply passing 
the hand over bowls they each take fire 
and produce a flame 12 to 20 inches high. 
Each bowl contains about_ 2 tea- 
spoonfuls of ether, upon which is placed 
a small piece of the metal potassium, 
about the size of a pea. If the ether be 
pure the potassium will not be acted 
upon. When the water is poured into 
the bowl the ether and potassium float 
up, the latter acting vigorously on the 
water, evolving hydrogen and setting fire 
thereto, and to the ether as well. _ 

The water may be poured into the 
bowl and lighted at command. In this 
case the potassium and ether are kept 
separated in the bowl, the former in a 
little cup on one side, and the latter in 

he holy of the bowl. The water » 
poured in, and on rocking the bowl it i*

potassium floats up, and the fire is prc-

Tn Take Boiling Lead in the Mouth.— 
The Jetl used, while not unlike lead in 
appearance, is not the ordinary metal 
St is really an alloy composed of the 
following substances; 

Bismuth.../ ? P ar * s 

Lead I P ar s 

rpj n 2 parts 

To prepare it, first melt the lead in a 
crucible, then add the bismuth and finally 
the tin, and stir well together with a piece 
of tobacco pipe stem. This "fusible 
metal" will melt in boiling water, and a 
teaspoon cast from the alloy will melt if 
very hot water be poured into it, or if 
boiling water be stirred with it. If the 
water be not quite boiling, as is pretty 
sure to be the case if tea from a teapot is 
used, in all probability the heat will be 
insufficient to melt the spoon. But by 
melting the alloy and adding to it a small 
quantity of quicksilver a compound will 
be produced, which, though solid at the 
ordinary temperature, will melt in water 
very much _ below the boiling point. 
Another variety of easily fusible alloy is 
made by melting together 

Bismuth 7 to 8 parts 

Lead 4 p arts 

Tin 2 parts 

Cadmium 1 to 2 parts 

This mixture melts at 158°, that given 
above at 208° F. 

( Either one of the several alloys above 
given will contain considerably leas heat 
man lead and in consequence be the 
more suitable for the purposes of a "Fire

Second Method.— This i is done with a 
ladle constructed similarly to the tin Cu 
in a previous trick. 1 he lead, genuine & 
this case, is, apparently, drunk from the 

that it 



ladle, which is then tilted, L ucu it to a T 
be seen to be empty. I he lead is COn 
cealed in the secret interior of the laul e 
and a solid piece of lead is m conclusion 
dropped from the mouth, as congealed 
metal. 

To Eat Burning Coals.— In the first 
place make a good charcoal fire in th e 
furnace. Just before commencing th e 
act throw in three or four pieces of soft 
pine. When burnt to a coal one cannot 
tell the difference between this and char- 
coal, except by sticking a fork into it. 
This will not burn in the least, while the 
genuine charcoal will. You _ can stick 
your fork into these coals without any 
difficulty, but the charcoal is brittle and 
hard; it breaks before the fork goes into 
it- 

Chain of Fire. — Take a piece of candle 
wick 8 or 10 inches long, saturated with 
kerosene oil, squeeze out surplus oil. 
Take hold of one end with your fire tongs, 
light by furnace, throw back your head, 
and lower it into your mouth wkiU ex- 
haling the breath freely. When all in, 
close your lips and remove m kandker- 

Ivoxe — Have a good hold of the end 
with the tongs, for if it should fall it would 
probablv inflict a serious burn; for this 
reason also no burning oil must drop 
from the cotton. 

Biting Off Red-Hot Iron.— Take a 
piece of hoop iron about 2 feet long, 
place it in a vise and bend it backward 
and forwards, about an inch f rem »J 
end, until it is nearly broken oil. 
this in a furnace until it becomes led a ■ 
then take it in your right hand, grasp 
broken end in your teeth, being ■caw 
not to let it touch your bps or 
tongue, make a "face" as i though n ^

Rat Poisons 

(See also Turpentine.) 

Poisons for rats may be divided into 
two classes, quick and slow. Potassium 
cyanide and strychnine belong to the 
hrst, and phosphorus and arsenic to the 
second. Both should be 



„ JJUILI » 

irom children, dogs, and cats, and this is 
west done by putting them in places too 
narrow for anything larger than a rat to 
squeeze into. *• ■* p 



*ti""~« 1 ' " lLU " ^ *he poison is too quick, 
T. ettec l of it is visible to the same rats 
r &1 ch saw the cause, and those which 
Gave nnt _r ^-l _ i. ;n i~- if 



echble things in the pantry, by vomiting. 
Slow poisons generally cause the rat to 
seek water, and when they are used 
water should not be left about promis- 
cuously. 

The substances most useful as rat 
poisons, and which are without danger 
to the larger domestic animals, are plas- 
ter of Paris and fresh squills. Less dan- 
gerous than strychnine and arsenic are 
the baryta preparations, of which the 
most valuable is barium carbonate. 
Like plaster of Paris, this substance, 
when used for the purpose, must be 
mixed with sugar and meal, or flour, and 
as a decoy some strong-smelling cheese 
should be added. In closed places there 
should be left vessels containing water 
easily accessible to the creatures. 

One advantage over these substances 
possessed by the squill is that it is greed- 
ily eaten by rats and mice. When it is 
used, however, the same precaution as 
to water, noted above, is necessary, a 
circumstance too frequently forgotten. 
In preparing the squill for this purpose, 
by the addition of bacon, or fat meat o 
any kind, the use of a decoy like chees 
is unnecessary, as the fats are sufii 
ciently appetizing to the rodents. It 
to be noted that only fresh squills shoy 1 
be used for this purpose, as in keepi 
the bulb the poisonous principle is c 
stroyed, or, at least, is so modified as t 
seriously injure its value. 

Squill Poisons.— The preparation 
the squill as a rat poison can be eftecte 
in several different ways. Usually, af 
ter the removal of the outer peel.the 
bulb is cut up into little slices and mn jed 
with milk and flour; these are sti md 
into a dough or paste, which wrth brts

Phosphorus Poisons.— Next to the 
ill fin value as a poison comes phos- 
Xrus inlhe shape P of an electuary or 
L pills For readily preparing the 
Sectuary when needed or ordered, it is 
: le gl U d ry plan to keep on hand a phos- 
phorate<f syrup made as foU°™L . 
P To 200 parts of simple syrup, m a 
strong flask add 50 parts of P^phorus 
and 10 parts of talc powder; place he 
Container in a suitable vesse and sur- 
round it with water heated tc .120 to 
130° F. and let it stand until the phos- 
phorus is melted. Now, cork the flask 
well, tie down the cork, and agitate until 
the mixture is completely cold. As a 
measure of precaution, the flask should 
be wrapped with a cloth. 

To make the poison take 50 parts of 
rye flour and mix with it 10 parts of pow- 
dered sugar. To the mixture add about 
40 parts of water and from 30 to 40 parts 
»)f the phosphorated syrup, and mix the 
mass thoroughly. 

While it is best to make the phosphor- 
ated syrup fresh every time that it is 
required, a stable syrup can be made as 
follows: 

Heat together very carefully in a water 
bath 5 parts of phosphorus, 3 parts of 
sublimed sulphur, and 30 parts of water, 
until the phosphorus is completely 
melted and taken up; then add 30 parts 
of wheat flour and 6 parts of ground 
mustard seed, and work up, with the ad- 
dition of warm water from time to time, 
if necessary, in to a stiff paste, finally 
adding and working in from 1 to 2 parts 
or oil of anise.

The razor pastes, razor creams, etc., 
on the market, have for their cutting, or 
sharpening, agent jewelers' rouge, or 
rouge and emery. When emery is used 
it should be ground to an impalpable 
powder and levigated. 

I.— The simplest formula is a mixture 
in equal parts of rouge and emery pow- 
der, rubbed up with spermaceti ointment. 
Coke is also used as a cutting agent. 
Suet, prepared lard, in fact, any greasy 
or soapy substance, -will answer for the 
vehicle. 

II.— Melt 1,000 parts of beef tallow 
and pour £50 parts of oil to it. To this 
Mixture, which is uniformly combined 
b y thorough stirring, add in the same 
banner 150 parts of washed emery, 100 
Parts of tin ashes, and 50 parts of iron 
oxide. The stirring of these ingredients 
must ° e continued until the mass is cool,

ROLLER COMPOSITION'S FOR PRINT- 
ERS. 

Rollers for transferring ink to types 
have to possess special properties, 
which have reference both to the nature 
of the ink and that of the types to which 
it is to be transferred. They must be as 
little liable as possible to changes of tem- 
perature. They -must be sticky, but 
only just sticky enough, and must have 
elasticity enough to exert a uniform 
pressure over the varying surface with 
which they meet in the form. Origi- 
nally, the composition was one of glue 
and molasses in varying proportions, and 
the only practical improvement that has 
been made is the addition of glycerine. 
This being slightly hygroscopic, helps to 
keep the roller at the right degree of 
softness, and being practically unfreez- 
able, it is a great assistance in keeping 
tae rollers from hardening in cold 
weather. 

The recipes given in technical works 
tor Panting roller compositions are 
numerous and very different. All con-

Soak the glue in the water and then 
liquefy by heat. Then stir in the oil, 
first heated to 150° F. Then add the 
molasses and the chloride of calcium, 
and finally the fused rosin. The latter 
ingredient is only to be added when very 
tough rollers are required. This recipe 
is interesting from the inclusion in it of 
the hygroscopic salt, chloride of calcium, 
the object of which is obviously to keep 
the rollers moist.

ROT: 

Remedies for Dry Rot— A good remedy 
for dry rot is petroleum. The sick parts 
of the wood are painted with it, which 
causes the fungi to die, turn black, and 
finally drop off. The best preventive of 
dry rot is plenty of draught. If the por- 
tions are already affected so badly that 
they must be removed and renewed, the 
freshly inserted wood is coated with "car- 
bolineum" to prevent a fresh appearance 
of dry rot. Another remedy is ordinary 
salt, which is known to have a highly 
hygroscopic action. It absorbs the moist- 
ure of the wood, whereby it is itself dis- 
solved, thus gradually impregnating the 
planks, etc. In order to combat dry rot 
with salt, proceed as follows: Throw salt 
into boiling water until a perfectly satu- 
rated solution is obtained. With this 
repeatedly wash the wood and masonry 
afflicted with dry rot. Wherever practi- 
cable the salt may be sprinkled direct 
upon the affected place.

ARTIFICIAL RUBBER. 

Austin G. Day tried hundreds of ex- 
periments and took out many patents 
for rubber substitutes. He was in a 
measure successful, his "Kerite" com-* 
pound proving of great value and being a 
result of his seeking for something that 
would wholly supplant rubber. As far 
back as 1866" he made public the results 
of some of his work, giving as formulas 
for rubber substitutes the following 
compounds:

Then were added 27 pounds linseed ^o 1 
the heat raised to 220° F., and 15 to 18 
pounds of sulphur added, the heat being 
continually raised until the mass was sul- 
phurized. When the heat reached 240 
F 1 to H ounces of nitric acid were 
added, and at 270° to 280° F , from 1 to 
3 ounces camphor were added to neip 
the sulphurization. The resultant com- 
pound was used on the following basis: . 

Yll.—Para rubber 20 pounds 

Litharge 5 pounds 

Sulphur 1 pound 

Above com- 

pound 20 to 40 pounds 

Mr. Day did not insist on the com- 
pound quoted, but advised that the pro- 
portions be varied as widely as the exi- 
gencies of the case might demand. 
Whiting, barytes, infusorial earth, white 
lead, blacks, in fact almost any of the 
oxides, carbonates, or earthy materials 
commonly used in compounding, were 
used in connection with his substitute, 
as also were any grades of crude rubber. 
Among other ingredients that he found 
°* use in making his substitutes were 
vegetable and animal waxes, together 
with ozokerite and paraffine. These 
were only used in small quantities, and 
always in connection with the linseed 
a V , cottonseed oils, and generally as- 
Phaltum or coal tar. One of his 
compounds also called for a quantity of 
golden sulphuret of antimony, presum- 



ably to assist in the sulphurization, and 
a small amount of tannic acid. 

Another line of experimenting that is 
interesting, and that will yet produce 
good results, although so far it has not 
amounted to much, is in the use of cellu- 
lose. A very simple formula is of 
French origin and calls for the treating 
of cellulose with sulphuric acid, washing, 
drying, granulating, treating with resi- 
nate of soda — which is afterwards pre- 
cipitated by sulphate of alumina — then 
drying and molding under pressure. As 
a matter of fact, the resultant mass would 
not be mistaken for rubber. An Eng- 
lish formula is more like it. This con- 
sists of 

VIII.— Cellulose 15 pounds 

Pitch 25 pounds 

Asphalt 20 pounds 

Silica 20 pounds 

Mastic 5 pounds 

Bitumen 5 pounds 

Rosin 10 pounds 

Coal tar 12 pounds 

This makes a thick gummy varnish 
which is of little use except as for its 
waterproof qualities. Allen s formula 
for a cellulose substitute might have a 
value if it were carried further. It is 
made up of 100 pounds of {™inous wooc 
pulp treated with animal gelatin, 100 
Sounds asphalt, and 10 pounds asphalt 
oil all heated and molded. 

The Greening process ^b^ p ^ s E JS 
lish, is more elaborate than Al en s, bu 
seems a bit laborious and costly. Th. 
process calls for the trea itjnent of the

Rubber and Rubber Articles. — As re- 
gards the action of coal gas on rubber 
tubes, it has been observed that it is 
weakest on ordinary gray rubber which 
withstands it the longest, and gives off 
no odor. Red rubber is more readily 
affected, and the black kind still more so. 

To prevent rubber tubes from drying 
up and becoming brittle, they should be 
coated with a 3 per cent aqueous solution 
of carbolic acid, which preserves them. 
If they have already turned stiff and 
brittle, they can be rendered soft and 
pliant again by being placed in ammonia 
which has been made liquid with double 
the amount of water. 

In France rubber tubes are used as a 
core for casting pipes from cement and 
sand. In order to construct a connected 
pipe conduit in the ground, a groove is 
aug and a layer of cement mortar spread 
out. Upon this the rubber tube is laid,

To prevent gas from escaping through 
rubber hose, cover it with a mixture pre- 
pared as follows: Dissolve 5 parts of 
gum arabic and 3 parts of molasses in lg 
parts of white wine and add, with con- 
stant stirring, 6 partsof alcohol in small 
quantities. Stirring is necessary to pre- 
vent the alcohol from precipitating the 
gum arabic. 

Repairing Rubber Goods. — First, clean 
off all adherent matter, and dry thorough- 
ly. Varnish or lacquer, as for instance on 
rubber shoes, may be removed with sand 
or emery paper, or even with a file, in the 
absence of one of these. The surface 
thus produced is then rubbed with ben- 
zine. A solution of Para rubber in ben- 
zine is then painted over the surface 
around the break or tear, and a strip of 
natural rubber fitted over it. Then pre- 
pare a vulcanizing solution as follows: 
Sulphur chloride.. . . 18 parts 

Benzine 400 parts 

Carbon disulphide . . 300 parts 

This is applied to the edges of the joint 
by means of a pledget of cotton wrapped 
on the end of a little stick, and press the 
jointed parts well together. , 

One may repair rubber bulbs by tie

olve it in alcohol (90 per cent) so that 
a thick paste forms, smear up the holes, 
allow all to harden well, and the rubber 
article, pillow, ball, knee caps, etc., may 
be used again. 

Softening Rubber —The hardening of 
gum articles is generally referable to 
these having been kept for a long time in 
some warm, dry place, though keeping them 
in the cold will produce the same effect. 
Hardness and brittleness, under any rea- 
sonable care and conditions, are usually 
signs of an inferior article of goods. Ar- 
ticles of Para rubber, of good workmanship, 
usually maintain their elasticity for a very 
long time. Before attempting to soften 
hollow rubber ware, such as flasks, water 
bags, or bottles, etc., they should be well 
scrubbed with a wire brush (bottle 
cleaner) and warm water, so as to re- 
move all dirt and dust. This scrubbing 
should be continued until the wash water 
comes, away clean and bright. For 
softening, the best agent is dilute water 
of ammonia, prepared by mixing phar- 
^acopoeial ammonia water, 1 part, and 
water, 2 parts. There should be enough 
of this to cover the articles, inside and

should be replaced from time to time, 
and the vessel should never be allowed 
to boil violently. When the proper time 
has arrived (and this must be learned, it 
appears, by experience, as the article 
quoted gives no directions save those 
translated), remove from the fire, and al- 
low to cool gradually. 

Glycerine has been also recommended, 
and it may be used with advantage in 
certain cases. The articles must first 
be cleaned with the brush and warm 
water, as above detailed. Heat them in 
water and rub them with a wad of cot- 
ton soaked in glycerine, drawing the wad 
over them, backwards and forwards. 
This wad should be wrapped with good 
stout wire, the ends of which are pro- 
longed, to serve as a handle. Where 
possible the articles should be stricken 
with the glycerine inside and out, the 
article being, naturally, held out of the 
boiling water, sufficiently, at least, to 
make bare the part being rubbed at the 
time. Let rest for 24 hours, and repeat 
this process. With goods kept in stock, 
that show a tendency to grow brittle, 
this treatment should be repeated every 
6 months or oftener. Never put away 
tubing, etc., treated in this manner until 
every particle of moisture has drained off 
or evaporated. 

Another authority, Zeigler, has the 
following on this subject: Tubing, 
bands, and other articles of vulcanized 
caoutchouc that have become brittle and 
useless, may be restored to usefulness, 
indeed, to their pristine elasticity, by 
treating them as follows: First, put them 
in a hot aqueous solution of tannic acid 
and tartar emetic. Next, transfer them 
to a cold aqueous solution of tannic acid 
and calcium sulphate. Mix the two [ so- 
lutions and heat to about the boiling 
point, and transfer the articles to the hot 
Son. This treatment should bemain- 
ained from 1 day to 3 or 4, according to 
tho nature and condition of the articles.

T h s is carried out by boiling in caustic 
soda solution, or sulphuric or hydro- 
chloric acid respectively, and steaming 
for about 20 hours with 4 atmospheres 

Pr Srding to another method the 
pound Scraps arc steamed with soda lye 
Eider pressure, washed twice thoroughly 
for the elimination of the lye and dried 
in the vacuum. Subsequently mix be- 
tween cold rollers with 5 to 10 per cent of 
benzol or mineral oil and steam for some 
hours under hydraulic pressure at 4 
atmospheres. The product thus ob- 
tained is rolled in plates and added to 
the mixture. The finely ground dry 
waste must not be stored for a long time 
in large quantities, as it hardens very 
easilv and takes fire. 

Ofd articles of vulcarized rubber are 
first "devulcanized" by grinding, boiling 
with, caustic soda, and washing thor- 
oughly. After drying, the scraps > are 
heated to 302° F."with linseed od in a 
kettle provided with stirring mechanism 
which is kept in continual motion. 
When' the rubber has dissolved, a quan- 
tity of natural or coal-tar asphalt is added, 
and as soon as the contents of the kettle 
have become well mixed, the tempera- 
ture is raised so high that dense fumes 
begin to rise and air is forced through 
the mass until a cooled sample shows 
the desired consistence. This compo- 
sition being very tough and flexible, 
forms an excellent covering for electric 
cables. It finds many other uses, the 
proportions of rubber, asphalt, and oil 
being varied in accordance with the 
purpose for which it is designed. 

Vulcanization. — Resides the Good- 
year, Mason, and other patented proc- 
esses the process now usually followed 
m vulcanizing rubber stamps and simi- 
ar small objects of rubber, is as fol- 
lows: 

Sulphur chloride is dissolved in car- 
bon disuiphide in various proportions, 
according to the degree of harefness the 
vulcamzed object is to receive; the rub- 
lefr "PlunBed in the solution and 
removing, lt 18 p l aced La a box Qr 



or about 90 to 100 seconds It V tV n 
washed in a weakly alkaline bath 0 f 
water, and dried. 

Another method (recommended } lv 
Gerard) depends upon letting the rubber 
lie in a solution of potassium ter or penta 
sulphide, of 25° Be., heated to about 
280° F. for 3 hours. 

Testing Rubber Gloves.— In testing 
rubber gloves it is best to inflate them 
with air, and then put them under water 
Thus one may discover many small holes 
in new ones which otherwise would havr 
been impossible to find. 

Dissolving Old Rubber.— The material 
is shredded finely and then heated, under 
pressure, for several hours, with a strong 
solution of caustic soda. All cloth, paint, 
glue, fillers, etc., in the rubber are disin- 
tegrated, but the rubber is not affected. 
The mass is then washed repeatedly -with 
water, to remove all alkali, and the re- 
sultant pure rubber may then be formed 
into sheets. 

Rubber Stamps, — Set up the desired 
name and address in common type, oil 
the type and place a guard about h inch 
high " around the form. JVIix plaster of 
Paris to the proper consistence, pour in 
and allow it to set. Have the vulcanized 
rubber all ready, as made in long strips 
3 inches wide and & of an inch thick, cut 
off the size of the intended stamp, remove 
the plaster cast from the type, and place 
both the cast and the rubber in a screw 
press, applying sufficient heat to thor- 
oughly soften the rubber. Then turn 
down the screw hard and let it remaiL 
until the rubber receives the exact im- 
pression of the cast and becomes coia. 
when it is removed, neatly trimmed WW 
a sharp knife, and cemented to the Han- 
dle ready for use.

Key are without exception acid-reactmg 
bodies, which absorb oxygen m the air

fisting oxidation than retarding it. A 
covering of wax dissolved m oil of tur- 
pentine would be more recommendabie, 
because wax is an impervious body, and 
a firm and rather hard layer remains 
after evaporation of the oil of turpen- 
tine, which excludes the air. If the 
treatment with the wax salve is carefully 
attended to no other objection can be 
urged against this preserving agent than 
that it is likewise comparatively ex- 
pensive if used in large quantities. As 
regards the greases, and treatment with 
petroleum or vaseline, the easy attrition of 
these substances is another drawback, 
which makes a lasting protection impos- 
sible. 

> According to Shedlok, cast-iron ar- 
ticles are treated with acids, then ex- 
posed to the action of steam, hot or cold 
water, and dried. The receptacle is ex- 
hausted of air and a solution of pitch, 
rosin, rubber, or caoutchouc, applied 
under pressure. Objects prepared in 
this manner are said to be impervious 
even to weak acids. 

The inoxidizing process of Ward is 
founded on the simultaneous employ- 
, ?^nt of silicates and heat. The cast 
iron or wrought iron are coated with a 
siliceous mass by means of a brush or 
a?" ^ m , ersio11 - Tll i s covering dries 
Sickly, becomes liquid when the articles 
e *P osed ^ a suitable heat, and soaks 
nio the pores of the metal, forming a 
cm ? nd un iform coat of dull black 
, °r after cooling, which is not changed 
moS e " COntinued influence of the at- 
s paere, and which neither scales nor 



peels from the object. By the admixture 
of glass coloring matters to the siliceous 
mass, decorated surfaces may be pro- 
duced. 

Another inoxidationprocess for cast 
iron is the following: The cast-iron ob- 
jects, such as whole gas chandeliers, 
water pipes, ornaments, balcony railings, 
cooking vessels, etc., are laid upon an 
iron sliding carriage 3.5 meters long and 
are exposed in a flame furnace of special 
construction first 15 minutes to the in- 
fluence of gas generators with oxidizing 
action, then 20 minutes to such with re- 
ducing action. _ After being drawn out and 
cooled off the inoxidized pieces take on a 
uniform slate-blue shade of color, but 
can be enameled and ornamented in any 
manner desired. In applying the enamel 
the corroding with acid is obviated, for 
which reason the enamel stands ex- 
ceedingly well. . 

A bronze-colored oxide coating which 
withstands outward influences fairly 
well, is produced as follows: The bright- 
ly polished and degreased objects are ex- 
posed from 2 to 5 minutes to the vapory 
of a heated mixture of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid and nitric acid (1:1) 
until the bronze color becomes visible

The rust-preventive composition 01 
Jones & Co., Sheffield, is a composition 
of wax, fat, turpentine, and small quan- 
tities of iron oxide. 

According to a process patented by A. 
Buchner in Germany, the iron objects 
are first painted with a mixture of an 
alkaline glue solution and rosin soap. 
The alkaline mass enters all the pores 
and fissures and prevents the rust from 
extending under the coating. After the 
first coat is dry a second one is applied 
of the following composition: Five parts 
linseed oil boiled with peroxide of man- 
ganese; 2.25 parts turpentine; 0.25 parts 
benzol; 20 parts zinc dust, carbonate of 
calcium, lead oxide, or peroxide of 
manganese. The mixing of the liquid 
with the powders must be done im- 
mediately before use, as the mass solidi- 
ties after 10 hours, and is then no longer 
of working consistency. The second 
coating, which should only be thin 
Hardens quickly. The paint is wcather- 
f > d °es not peel off or blister, and 
adheres so firmly that it can only be re- 
moved with mechanical means. 

A patented process to prevent rusting 
of wrought or cast iron consists in ap- 
plying .with a brush a strong solution of 



potassium dich 
stovi

stove or over an open fire. Drying at

A permanent lustrous rust preve^T 
is secured as follows: The well-cW 
iron parts are suspended for a f 
minutes in a blue vitriol solution, sot?, 
a delicate skin of copper forms on ?K 
surface; if the pieces rinsed off vJf 
■water are then moved about for a few 
minutes in a solution of sodium hy^o 
sulphite faintly acidulated with hydro 
chloric acid, they assume a blue-black 
coating of copper sulphide, which i 3 
equally permanent in air and in Water 
The black surface may be immediately 
rinsed with water, dried with a rag or 
blotting paper, and polished at once. It 
possesses a steel-blue luster, adheres -well 
to the iron, will stand treatment with the 
scratch brush, and protects against rust 
in a most satisfactory manner. 

Black Sheet Rust Preventive.— Before 
black plate is ready to receive a rust pro- 
tective coating, it is necessary to render 
the surface free from grease and scales, 
for which purpose the sheet iron is placed 
for some time into a warmed solution oE 
10 parts of sulphuric acid in 100 parts 
of water, whereby the impurities become 
detached, a process which may be as- 
sisted and accelerated by scouting with 
sand. Then rinse in clean water and 
rub dry in sawdust. The sheets thus 
prepared are placed for a short while 
into a feeble solution of blue vitriol, 
where they assume a reddish coloring. 
Next, they are rinsed in water, and alter 
that moved to and fro, for a short tune, 
in a feeble solution of hyposulplu k ■ « 
soda acidulated with a little hydrochloric 
acid. The result is a dark-blue coaug, 
on the sheets, which prevents au o» 
tion. In

alkaline solution of liLharge, a very ad- 
herent, brilliant, black deposit of perox- 
ide of lead is secured. Too energetic a

cause a pulverulent deposit. To obtain 
a good coating it is necessary, after put-

Paper as Protection for Iron and Steel. 

—That paraffine paper is a very good 
protector of iron and steel has been 
proven by tests conducted by Louis H. 
Barker for the Pennsylvania Railroad. 
The mode of applying the paraffine 
paper is as follows: After the rust is 
carefully cleaned off by means of stiff 
wire brushes, a tacky paint is applied, 
i he paper is then covered over and 
tightly pressed upon tne painted surface, 
™e joints of the paper slightly lapping. 
As soon as the paper is in place it is ready 
ior the outside coat of paint. Iron and

Rust Paper.— Rust paper is produced 
by coating strong packing paper with 
hnseed-oil varnish, size, or any other 
binder, and sprinkling on the powder 
given in previous formula. For use the 
paper must be moistened with petroleum. 

Anti-Rust Pastes. — I. — This prepar- 
ation serves for removing rust already 
present, as well as for preventing same, 
by greasing the article with it: Melt 5 
parts of crude vaseline on the water bath, 
and mix with 5 parts of finely levigated 
powdered pumice stone into a uniform 
mass. To the half-way cooled mass add 
\ part of crude acid oxalate of potassium 
(sorrel salt) in a finely powdered state 
and grind into complete homogeneity. 

II. — Dry tallow, 25 parts; white wax, 
23 parts; olive oil, 22 parts; oil of tur- 
pentine, 25 parts; mineral oil, 10 parts. 
Apply with a brush at the fusing tem- 
perature of the mixture. 

Rust Prevention for Iron Pipes.— The 
pieces of pipe are coated with tar and 
filled with light wood sawdust, which is 
set afire. This method will fully pro- 
tect the iron from rust for an unlimited 
period, rendering a subsequent coat alto- 
gether superfluous. 

Rust Preventive for Tools, etc.— I. — 
To preserve tools, dies, etc., from rust, 
they should be greased well with yellow 
vaseline. To use oil is not advisable, 
since all oils, except the dear ones, which 
are too expensive for this purpose con- 
tain a certain percentage of aeid that has 
an injurious effect upon the steel and 
iron articles. For greasing the cavities 
use a hard brush. 

II —Carefully heat benzine and add 
half 'its weight of white wax, which dis- 
solves completely in this ratio. 1 Ins

Salts, Effervescent 

Granulated effervescent salts are pro- 
duced by_ heating mixtures of powdered 
itric acid, tartaric acid, sodium bi- 
carbonate, and sugar to a certain temper- 
ature, until they assume the consistency 
of a paste, which is then granulated and 
dried. 

If effervescent caffeine citrate, anti- 
pynn, lithium citrate, etc., are to be pre- 
pared the powder need not be dried bc-

the production of the granulation 
must not exceed 158° F., and f ot 
the grains a temperature of l^o 
sufficient. 1 « 

The fineness of the mesh should Va 
according, to the necessary admixture n y f 
sugar and the size ot the grains. 1 

If the ingredients should have 
tendency to cling to the warm bottom 
an effort should be made immediately 
upon the commencement of the reaction 
to cause a new portion of the surface to 
come in contact with the hot walls. 

When the mass is of the consistency 
of paste it is pressed through a wire sieve 
paper or a fabric being placed under- 
neath. Afterwards dry at sufficient heat 
For wholesale manufacture, surfaces oj 
large size are employed, which are heated 
by steam. 

In the production of substances con- 
taining alkaloids, antipyrin, etc., caie 
must be taken that they do not become 
colored. It is well, therefore, not to use 
heat, but to allow the mixture to stand in 
a moist condition for 12 hours, adding 
the medicinal substances afterwards and 
kneading the whole in a clay receptacle. 
After another 12 hours the mass will 
have become sufficiently paste-like, so 
that it can be granulated as above 

According to another much employed 
method, the mass is crushed with alcohol 
then rubbed through a sieve, and dried 
rapidly. This process is somewhat 
dearer, owing to tne great loss of alcohol 
but presents the advantage ot furnishing 
a better product than any other recipe. 

Effervescent magnesium citrate cau 
not be very well made; for this rea on 
the sulphate was used in lieu oi i

mixture of sulphate is replaced by

as sodium phosphate, magnesium sul- 
nhate citrated caffeine, potassium bro- 
Lde lithium citrate, potassium citrate, 
an d others, will produce satisfactory 
products. A typical formula for effer-

Dry the sodium phosphate on a water 
hath until it ceases to lose weight; after 
powdering the dried salt, mix it intimate- 
ly with the citric acid and tartaric acid, 
then thoroughly incorporate the sodium 
bicarbonate. The mixed powders are 
now ready for granulation. The change 
m manipulation which is suggested to 
replace that usually followed, requires 
either a gas stove or a blue-flame coal-oil 
stove, and one of the small tin or sheet- 
iron ovens which are so largely used with 
jnese stoves. The stove itself will be

through a suitable sieve, the best kind 
and size being a tinned iron, No. 6 
This moist, granular powder may then 
be placed upon the top of the oven, where 
the heat is quite sufficient to thoroughly 
dry the granules, and the operator may 
proceed immediately with the next lot of 
mixed powder, easily granulating 10 or 
more pounds within an hour. 

Sugar has often been proposed as an 
addition to these salts, but experience 
has shown that the slight improvement 
in taste, which is sometimes questioned, 
does not offset the likelihood of darken- 
ing, which is apt to occur when the salt is 
being heated, or the change in color after 
it has been made several months. It 
should be remembered that in making 
a granular effervescent salt by the method 
which depends upon the liberation of 
water of crystallization, a loss in weight, 
amounting to about 10 per cent, will be 
experienced. This is due, in part, to 
the loss of water which is driven off, and 
also to a trifling loss of carbon dioxide 
when the powder is moistened.

SALT, USES FOR: 

Brass can be readily cleaned with a 
solution of salt and vinegar. A saturated 
solution of salt in water when washing 
clothes will prevent colors from running. 
Salt should be added to water before spa- 
ghetti, potatoes or vegetables are boiled 
in it. A speck of salt added to cream 
helps in whipping. An excellent throat 
gargle, which is highly recommended by 
physicians, is salt water. To keep clothes 
from freezing on the line add salt to the 
rinsing water. Salt eaten with nuts aids 
digestion. Egg stains on silver can easily 
be removed with the use of salt. Carpets 
can be cleaned easily and will look bright- 
er if salt is sprinkled on them. Rust 
stains can be removed by rubbing salt 
and lemon on them and then drying in 
the sun.

SHAVING PASTE. 

An emulsion of paraffme wax, m e n 



at I3l° F., should be used. "fhlsTf 5 
pared with 25 per cent of wax and g w 
cent of tragacanth, the wax being mdted 
and mixed with the tragacanth previous 
ly made into a mucilage with some oE the 
water. The addition of a little stearine 
or lard renders the emulsificatioiL of the 
wax easier, while about 10 per cent of 
alcohol makes the preparation more 
agreeable to use. The fatty odor of the 
preparation may be covered by the ad- 
dition of £ to l per cent of lavender oil, 
and the finished product then appears as 
a thick white cream. In use a small 
quantity is rubbed over the area to be 
shaved and the razor immediately ap- 
plied. As the water in the emulsion 
evaporates, the particles of was previ- 
ously distributed in the emulsion become 
coherent and fill up the depressions in 
the surface of the skin from which the 
hairs arise, thus forming a mechanical 
support during the passage of the razor. 
The quantity required is very small, 
ounce being sufficient 
face about 6 times.
