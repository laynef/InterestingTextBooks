Phosphor Bronze. — Phosphor bronze 
is bronze containing varying amounts 
of phosphorus, from a few hundredths 
of 1 per cent to 1 or 2 per cent. Bronze 
containing simply copper and tin is very 
liable to be defective from the 



xx^^ presence 

of oxygen, sulphur, or occluded gases. 
Oxygen causes the metal to he snnn™

vAygeii causes tiie metal to be spongy 
and weak. Sulphur and occluded gases 
cause porosity. Oxygen gets into the 
metal by absorption from the air. It can 
be eliminated by adding to the metal 
something which combines with the oxy- 
gen and then fluxes off. Such deoxidizers 
are zinc, antimony, aluminum, man-

A bronze is sometimes made Jig 




form for use, and the process of ffi , 1 
facture is as follows: Ninety Do S" 
of copper are melted under charcoal- 
a No. 70 crucible, which holds aboit 



200 pounds of metal when full-" i, 
pounds of tin are added and the metal ' 
allowed to become hot. The crucible k 
then removed from the furnace and 7 
pounds of phosphorus are introduced 
in the following manner: A 3-gallon 
stone jar s> half full of dilute solution 
of blue vitriol, is weighed. Then the 
weights are increased 7 pounds, and 
phosphorus in sticks about 4 inches 
long is added till the scales balance 
again. The phosphorus is left in this 
solution half an hour or longer, the phos- 
phorus being given a coating of copper, 
so that it may be dried and exposed to 
the air without igniting. Have ready 
a pan about 30 inches square and 6 
inches deep, containing about 2 inches of 
"water. Over the water is a wire netting, 
which is laid loose on ledges or supports 
along the inner sides of the pan. On the 
netting is blotting paper, and on this the 
phosphorus is laid to dry when taken 
out of the blue-vitriol solution. The pan 
also has a lid which can be put down in 
case of ignition of the phosphorus. 

The phosphorus is now readj; for 
introduction into the metal. This 13 
done by means of a cup-shaped mstru* 
ment called a retort or phosphorizer. 
One man holds the retort on the run of 
the crucible in a horizontal position. A 
second man ta kes about three pieces 01 
phosphorus and throws them into we 
retort- The first man then immediately 
plunges the mouth of the retort beiov

ALLOYS 



t e n copper has the marked property of 
absorbing various gases. It is for this 
reason that it is so difficult to make sound 
castings of clear copper. Molten copper 
combines readily with the oxygen of the 
B Jr, forming oxide of copper^ which dis- 
solves in the copper and mixes homo- 
geneously with it. 

A casting- made from sticn metal would 
be very spongy. The bad effect of oxy- 
gen is intended to be overcome by adding 
zinc to the extent of 1 per cent or more. 
This result can be much more effectively 
attained by the use of aluminum, man- 
ganese, or phosphorus. The action of 
§iese substances is to combine with the 
oxygen, and as the product formed sepa- 
rates and goes to the surface, the metal 
is left in a sound condition. Aluminum 
and manganese deoxidize copper and 
bronze very effectively, and the oxide 
formed goes to the surface as a scum. 
When a casting is made from such metal, 
the oxide or scum, instead of freeing it- 
self from the casting perfectly, generally 
remains in the top part of the casting 
mixed with the metal, as a fractured 
surface will show. Phosphorus deox- 
idizes copper, and the oxide formed 
leaves the metal in the form of a gas, so 
that a casting made from such metal 
shows a clean fracture throughout, al- 
though the metal is not so dense as when 
aluminum or manganese is used. 

Copper also has the property of ab- 
sorbing or occluding carbon monoxide. 
But the carbonic oxide thus absorbed 
is in a different condition from the oxy- 
gen absorbed. When oxygen is ab- 
sorbed by copper, the oxygen combines 
chemically with the copper and loses its 
own identity as a gas. But when coal 
gas is absorbed by the copper, it keeps

m Gun bronze contains copper and tii 
in the proportion of 9 or 10 parts of 
copper to 1 of tin. This is the metal 
used when an ordinary bronze castine 
is wanted. A harder bronze is copper 
and tin m the ratio of 6 to 1. This is 
often used as a bearing metal. Wher 
either of these metals is to be turned ii 
the machine shop, they should contaii 
about 3 per cent of lead, which will mah 
them work very much better, but it alsc 
decreases their tensile strength. Bear 
ing metal now generally contains abou, 
10 per cent of lead, with copper and tin 
in varying ratios. The large percentage 
of lead is put in that the metal may wear 
away slower. Lead, although a metal 
having properties similar to tin, acts en- 
tirely different toward copper. Copper 
and tin have a good deal of affinity foj 
each other, but copper and lead shoi 
no attraction at all for each other. Cop 
per and tin mix in all proportions^ but 
copper and lead mix only to a very limit 
ed extent. About 3 per cent of lead cai 
be mixed with copper. With bronzt 
about 15 i>er cent to 20 per cent of leac 
can be mixed. In bearing bronze th< 
lead keeps its own physical properties, 
so that the constituent lead melts long 
before the metal attains a red heat. It 
sometimes happens when a bearing runs 
warm that the lead actually sweats out 
and forms pimples on the metal. Or, 
sometimes, in remelting a bearing bronze 
casting the lead may be seen to drop 
out while the metal is warming up. All 
of these metals, however, should contain 
something to flux or deoxidize them, 
such as zinc, manganese, aluminum, 
silicon, antimony, or phosphorus. 

The phosphor bronze bearing metal m 
vogue has the following compositi on : Cop- 
lev. 79.7 per cent; tin, 10 per cent; lead.

a temperature as is consistent with get- 
ting P good casting, stir weU again, and 
poifr. The molds for this kind of work 
are faced with plumbago. 

There are several firms that make 



are 



phosphor-bronze bearings with a com- 
position similar to the above one, and 
most of them, or perhaps all, make it by 
melting the metals and then charging 
with phosphorus to the extent of 0. i to 
1 per cent. But some metal from all 
brands contains occluded gas. bo tnat 
after such metal is cast (in about two 
minutes or so) the metal will ooze or 
sweat out through the gate, and such a 
casting will be found to be porous. But 
not one such experience with metal made 
as described above has yet been found. 

This practical point should be heeded, 
viz., that pig phosphor bronze should be 
brought to the specifications that the 
metal should have shrunk in the ingot 
mold in cooling, as shown by the con- 
cave surface of the upper side, and that 
it should make a casting in a sand mold 
without rising in the gate after being 
poured. 

Iu bearing metal, occluded gas is very 
objectionable, because the gas, in trying 
to free itself, shoves the very hard cop- 
per-tin compound (which has a low 
melting point and remains liquid after 
the copper has begun to set) into spots, 
and thus causes hard spots in the metal. 

Phosphorus is very dangerous to han- 
dle, and there is great risk from fire with 
it, so that many would not care to handle 
the phosphorus itself. But phosphor 
copper containing 5 per cent of phos- 
phorus, and phosphor tin containing 2 to 
7 per cent of phosphorus, and several 
other such alloys can be obtained in the 
market It may be suggested to those 
who wish to make phosphor bronze, but 
do not want to handle phosphorus itself, 
to make it by using the proper amounts 
of one of these high phosphorus alloys. 
In using phosphorus it is only necessary 
to use enough to thoroughly deoxidize 
the metal, say 0.3 per cent. More than 
tins will make the metal harder, but not 
any sounder. 

Phosphor bronze is not a special kind 
or alloy, but any bronze can be made 
into phosphor bronze; it is, in fact, sim- 
ply a deoxidized bronze, produced under 
treatment with phosphorus compounds. 

Although the effect of phosphorus in 
improving the quality of bronze has been 



known for more than fifty years it 1 
of late that the mode for p re pari n V Jr* 
phor bronze has been perfected I 
now manufactured in many local V is 
Besides its action in reducing the r,-j S ' 
dissolved in the alloy, the phosphor? 
exerts another very material influ^ 
upon the properties of the bronze 
ordinary bronzes consist of mixture 
which the copper is really the only en"* 
tallized constituent, since the tin cr 
tallizes with great difficulty. A.s a e^" 
sequence of this dissimilarity in the 
ture of the two metals, the alloy i s 
so solid as it would be if both were crys 
tallized. The phosphorus causes the 
tin to crystallize, and the result is a more 
homogeneous mixture of the two metals. 

If enough phosphorus is added, so 
that its presence can be delected in the 
finished bronze, the latter may be con- 
sidered an alloy of crystallized phosphor 
tin with copper, If the content of phos- 
phor is still more increased, a part of the 
copper combines with the phosphorus, 
and the bronze then contains, besides 
copper and tin, compounds of crystal- 
lized copper phosphide with phosphide 
of tin. The strength and tenacity of the 
bronze are not lessened by a larger 
amount of phosphorus, and its hardness 
is considerably increased. Most phos- 
phor bronzes are equal in this respect to 
the best steel, and some even surpass it 
in general properties. 

The phosphorus is added to the bronze 
in the form of copper phosphide or phos- 
phide of tin, the two being sometimes 
used together. They must be specially 
prepared for this purpose, and the best 
methods will be here given. Copper 
phosphide is prepared by heating a mix- 
ture of 4 parts of superphosphate of lime, 
2 parts of granulated copper, and 1 pa« 
of finely pulverized coal m a crucible at* 
temperature not too high. 1 h e me " t

Hoy to be treated is melted in the usual

P phosphor bronze, properly prepared, 
, nearly the same melting point as that 
f ordinary bronze. In cooling, how- 
ever, it has the peculiarity of passing 
Htrectly from the liquid to the solid state, 
without first becoming thickly fluid. In 
ni elted state it retains a perfectly bright 
urface, while ordinary bronze in this 
condition is always covered with a thin 
film of oxide. 

If phosphor bronze is Kept ior a long 
time at the melting point, there is not 
au y loss of tin, but the amount of phos- 
phorus is slightly diminished._ 

The most valuable properties of phos- 
phor bronze are its extraordinary te- 
nacity and strength. It can be rolled, 
laramered, and stretched cold, and its 
strength is nearly doable that of the best 
ordinary bronze. It is principally used 
in cases where great strength and power 
of resistance to outward influences are re- 
quired, as, for instance, in objects which 
are to be exposed to the action of sea water. 

Phosphor bronze containing about 4 
jer cent of tin is excellently well adapted 
or sheet bronze. With not more than 5 
jer cent of tin, it can be used, forged, 
or firearms. Seven to 10 per cent of 
tin gives the greatest hardness, and such 
Dronze is especially suited to the manu- 
facture of axle bearings, cylinders for 
steam fire engines, cogwheels, and, in 
general, for parts of machines where 
|eat strength and hardness are required. 
3 hosphor bronze, if exposed to the air, 
soon becomes covered with a beautiful, 
closely adhering patina, and is therefore 
well adapted to purposes of art. The 
amount of phosphorus added varies 
from 0.25 to 2.5 per cent, according to 
.purpose of the bronze. The com- 
position of a number of kinds of phos- 
phor bronze is given below:

Baudoin Metal. — This is composed of 
72 parts of copper, 10.6 of nickel, 1.8 of 
cobalt, 1 of zinc; i per cent of aluminum 
may be added. 

CASTING COPPER: 

Macht's Yellow Metal. — L — This alloy 
consists of 33 parts of copper and 25 of 
zinc. It has a dark golden-yellow color, 
great tenacity, and can be forged at a 
red heat, properties which make it es- 
pecially suitable for fine eastings. 

EC.— Yellow.— Copper, 67 to 70 parts; 
zinc, 33 to 30 parts. 

Ill- — Red. — Copper, 82 parts; zinc, 
18 parts. 

Copper Arsenic, — Arsenic imparts to 
copper a very fine white color, and makes 
it very hard and brittle. Before Ger- 
man silver was known, these alloys were 
sometimes used for the manufacture of 
such cast articles as were not to come in 
' contact with iron. When exposed to the 
^ air, they soon lose their whiteness and 
f i-° n a brownish shade. On account 
|l this, as well as the poisonous character 
°1 t u e arsen i c > ^ey are very little used 
at the present time. Alloys of copper 
and arsenic are best prepared by pressing 
nrmly mto a crucible a mixture of 70 
j Parts of copper and SO of arsenic (the 
, c °pper to be used in the form of fine 
•shavings) and fusing this mixture in a 
furnace with a good draught, under a 
, cover of glass. b 

Copper Iron.— The alloys of copper 
j and iron are little used in the industries 
uLl ■ present day, but it would seem

Copper mckel. T A. Morrell, of Ne* 

York, nas obtained a patent on a nickel- 
copper alloy which he claims is valu- 
able on account of .its noncorrosive 
qualities, therefore making it desirable 
tor ships, boiler tubes, and other uses 
where the metal comes much in contact 
with water. The process of making the 
metal is by smelting ore containing sul- 
phide of nickel and copper, and b es era- 
en zi rig the resultant matter. This is 
calcined in order to obtain the nickel 
and copper in the form of oxides. Tht 
latter are reduced in reverberating fur 
nace with carbon, or the like, so as to 
produce an alloy which preferably con- 
tains 2 parts of nickel and 1 part of 
copper. 

Delta Metal. — An alloy widely used for 
making parts of machinery, and also 
for artistic purposes, is the so-called 
Delta metal. This is a variety of brass 
hardened with iron; some manufacturers 
add small quantities of tin and lead; 
also, in some cases, nickel. The follow- 
ing analysis of Delta metal (from the fac- 
tory at Dilsseldorf) will show its usus 1

Gong Metal. — A sonorous metal for 
^vmhaTs fronts, and tam-tams consists 
of ?0 parts of copper with 25 parts tin 
finite the piece after it is cast and plunge 
it into cold water immediately. 

Production of Minargent.— This alloy 
consists of copper 500 parts; mckel 
S50; tungsten, 25, and aluminum,... Ihe 
metal obtained possesses a handsome 
white color and greatly resembles silver. 

Minofor .— The so-called Minofor metal

Minargent and Minofor are sometimes 
used in England for purposes in which th« 
ordinary Britannia metal, 2 parts tin and 
1 part antimony, might equally well be 
employed; the latter surpasses both of 
them in beauty of color, but they are, on 
the other hand, harder. 

Retz Alloy. — This alloy, which resists 
the corrosive action of alkalies and acids, 
is composed of 15 parts of copper, 2.34 
of tin, 1.82 of lead, and 1 of antimony. 
It can be utilized in the manufacture of 
receivers, for which porcelain and ebo- 
nite are usually employed. 

Ruoltz Metal. — This comprises 20 

?arts of silver, 50 of copper, 30 of nickel, 
'hese proportions may, however, vary. 
Tissier's Metal. — This alloy contains 
arsenic, is of a beautiful tombac red 
color, and very hard. Its composition 
varies a great deal, but the peculiar alloy 
which gives the name is composed of 
copper, 97 parts; zinc, 2 parts; arsenic, 
1 or 2. It may be considered a brass 
with a very high percentage of copper, 
and hardened by the addition of arsenic. 
It is sometimes used for axle bearings, 
but other alloys are equally suitable for 
this purpose, and are to be preferred on 
account of the absence of arsenic, which 
is always dangerous. 

FILE ALLOYS. — Many copper-tin al- 
loys are employed for the making of tiles 
which, in distinction from the steel files, 
are designated composition files. Such 
alloys have the following compositions:

Lipowitz Metal. — This amalgam is pre- 
pared as follows: Melt in a dish, cad- 
mium, 3 parts, by weight; tin, 4 parts; 
bismuth, 15 parts; and lead, 8 parts, 
adding to the^ alloy, while still in fusion, 
2 parts of quicksilver previously heated 
to about 212° F. The amalgamation 
proceeds easily and smoothly. The 
liquid mass in the dish, which should 
be taken from the fire immediately upon 
the introduction of the mercury, is stirred 
until the contents solidify. While Lipo- 
witz alloy softens already at 140° F. and 
fuses perfectly at 158°, the amalgam has 
a still lower fusing rioint. which lies 
around 143?° F

Ihis amalgam is excellently adapted 
tor the production of impressions of 
various objects of nature, direct im- 
pressions of leaves, and other delicate

or copper sulphate by boiling a solutio 
of the same in water with some zinc filin 
in order to obtain entirely pure coppe 
Of the copper powder obtained in this ma 
ner, 20, 30, or 36 parts, by weight, accor 
ing to the degree of hardness desired fo 
the composition (the greater the quanti 
of copper used the harder will the compos 
tion become), are thoroughly moistene 
in a cast-iron or porcelain mortar wit 
sulphuric acid of 1.85 specific gravit 
70 parts, by weight, of mercury are the 
added to this paste, the whole being co~ 
stantly stirred. When all the copp 
has been thoroughly amalgamated wit 
the mercury, the sulphuric acid is washe 
out again with boiling water, and in 1 
hours after it has become cold the com 
position will be so hard that it canb 
polished. It is impervious to the actio 
of dilute acids, alcohol, ether, and boil

Quick -Water. — That the amalgam 
may easily take hold of bronze objects 
and remain there, it is customary to 
cover the perfectly cleansed and shining 
article with a thin coat of mercury, which 
is usually accomplished by dipping it into 
a so-called quick- water bath. 

In the form of minute globules the 
mercury immediately separates itself 
from the solution and clings to the bronze 
object, which thereupon presents the 
appearance of being platea with silver. 
After it has been well rinsed in clean 
water, the amalgam may be evenly and 
without difficulty applied with the 
scratch brush. 

This quick- water (in reality a solution 
of mercurous nitrate), is made in the sim- 
plest manner by taking 10 parts of mer- 
cury and pouring over it 11 parts of 
nitric acid of a specific gravity equal to 
133; now let it stand until every part 
of the mercury is dissolved; then, while 
stirring vigorously, add 540 parts of 
water. This solution must be kept in 
closed flasks or bottles to prevent im- 
purities, such as dust, etc., from falling 
into it. fe 

The preparatory work on the object 
to be gilded consists mainly in cleansing 
It irom every trace of oxidation. First 
It must be well annealed by placing it in 
a bed. of glowing coal, care being cxer- 
Wh ^ the heating be uniform.

deux (9 carat), are composed of 3, % or 
1 part of gold respectively, with 1 part of 
an alloy consisting of two-thirds silver and 
one-third copper. Gold also forms with 
aluminum a series of alloys of greatly vary- 
ing coloration, the most curious of them, 
composed of 22 parts of aluminum for 88 
parts of gold, possessing a pretty purple 
shade. _ But all these alloys, of a highly 
crystalline base, arc very brittle and can- 
not be worked, for which reason their 
handsome colorings have not yet been 
capable of being utilized. 
Enameling Alloys. — I. Transparent. 
This alloy should possess the property 
of transmitting rays of light so as to give 
the highest possible effect to the enamel. 
The alloy of gold for transparent green 
should be pale; a red or copper alloy 
does not do for green enamel, the copper 
has a tendency to darken the color and 
tnua take away a part of its brilliancy.

Gold-leaf Alloys.— All gold made into 
leaf is more or less alloyed. The gold 
used by the goldbeater is alloyed ac- 
cording to the variety of color required. 
Fme gold is commonly supposed to be in- 
capable of being reduced to thin leaves. 
This, however, is not the case, although 
its use for ordinary purposes is unde- 
sirable on account of its greater cost. It 
also adheres by contact of one leaf with 
another, thus causing spoiled material 
and wasted labor; but for work exposed v 
to the weather it is much preferable, as 
it is more durable and does not tarnish 
or change color.

classes of leaf recognized and ordinarily

molds, and is then ready for use. .The 
alloy thus made is said to be fine-grained, 
malleable, takes a high polish, and does 
not easily oxidize. , 

II —An invention, patented in uer- 
manv, covers a metallic alloy, to take 
the place of gold, which, even if exposed 
for sometime to the action of ammonia- 
cal and acid vapors, does not oxidize or 
lose its gold color. It can be rolled and 
worked Tike gold and has the appearance 
of genuine gold without containing the 
slightest admixture of that metal. The 
alloy consists of copper and antimony m 
the approximate ratio of 100 to 6, and is 
produced by adding to molten copper, 
as soon as it has reached a certain degree 
of heat, the said percentage of antimony. 
When the antimony; has likewise melted 
and entered into intimate union with the 
copper, some charcoal ashes, magne- 
sium, and lime spar are added to the mass 
when the latter is still in the crucible. 

III. Aluminum Gold. — This alloy, 
called Nuremberg gold, is used for mak- 
ing cheap gold ware, and is excellent for 
this purpose, as its color is exactly that of 
pure gold, and does not change in the air. 
Articles made of Nuremberg gold need 
no gilding, and retain their color under 
the hardest usage; even the fracture of 
this alloy shows the pure gold color. The 
composition is usually 90 parts of cop- 
per, 2.5 of gold, and 7.5 of aluminum. 

IV. — Imitation gold, capable of being 
worked and drawn into wire, consists of 
950 parts copper, 45 aluminum, and 2 to 
5 of si) ver.

position to Mannheim gold:

Mosaic Gold.- -This Is an alloy com 
posed— with slight deviations— 0 f iqq 
parts of copper and 50 to 55 of zinc. It 
has a beautiful color, closely resembling 
that of gold, and is distinguished by a 
very fine grain, which makes it especially 
suitable for the manufacture of castings 
which are afterwards to be gilded. The 
best method of obtaining a thoroughly 
homogeneous mixture of the two metals 
is first to put into the crucible one-half 
of the zinc to be used, place the cover 
upon it, and fuse the mixture under a 
cover of borax at as low a temperature 
as possible. Have ready the other half 
of the zinc, cut into small pieces and 
heated almost to melting, and when the 
contents of the crucible are liquid throw 
it in, a small portion at a time, stirring 
constantly to effect as intimate a mixture 
of the metals as possible. 

Oreide or Oroide (French Gold).— The 
so-called French gold, when polished, so 
closely resembles genuine gold in color 
that it can scarcely be distinguished from 
it. Besides its beautiful color, it has the 
valuable properties of being very ductile 
and tenacious, so that it can easily be 
stamped into anv desired shape; it also 
takes a high polish. It is frequently 
used for the manufacture of spoons, 
forks, etc., but is unsuitable for this pur- 
pose on account of the large amount ol 
copper contained in it, rendering it i D " 
jurious to health. The directions M 
preparing this alloy vary greatly. -J-JI

Pinchbeck. — This was first manufac- 
tured in England. Its dark gold color 
is the best imitation of gold alloyed with 
copper. Being very ductile, it can easily 
be rolled out into thin plates, which can 
be given any desired shape by stamping. 
It does not readily oxidize, and thus 
fulfills all the requirements for making 
cheap jewelry, which is its principal use.

Palladium Gold. — Alloys of gold, cop- 
per, silver, and palladium have a brown- 
ish-red color and are nearly as hard as iron. 
They are sometimes (although rarely) 
used for the bearings for the axles of the 
wheels of fine watches, as they invite little 
friction and do not rust in the air. The 
composition used in the Swiss and Eng- 
lish watch factories consists usually of 
gold 18 parts, copper 13 parts, silver 11, 
aad palladium 6. 

Talmi Gold.— The name of talmi gold 
was_ first applied to articles of jewelry, 
chains, earrings, bracelets, etc., brought 
from Paris, and distinguished by beau- 
tiful workmanship, a low price, and 
great durability. " Later, when this al- 
loy had acquired a considerable reputa- 
tion, articles were introduced under the 
same name, but which were really made 
of other metals, and which retained their 
beautiful gold color only as long as they 
were not used. The fine varieties of tal mi 
gold are manufactured from brass, cop- 
per, or tombac, covered with a thin plate 
?i gold, combined with the base by roll- 
ing, under strong pressure. The plates 
are then rolled out by passing through 
tollers, and the coating nut only acquires 
considerable density," but adheres so 
closely to the base that the metal will

Japanese Alloys. — In Japan som 

specialties in metallic alloys are in use< 
which the composition is as follows: 

Shadke consists of copper with from 1 
10 per cent of gold. Articles made fro 
this alloy are laid in a pickle of bl 
vitriol, alum, and verdigris, until th 
acquire a bluish-black color. 

Gui-shi-bu-ichi is an alloy of copr 
containing 30 to 50 per cent of silver, 
possesses a peculiar gray shade. 

Mokume consists of several conrposi 
tions. Thus, about 30 gold foils (ge~ 
uine) are welded together with shac ' 
copper, silver, and gui-shi-bu-ichi 
pierced. The pierced holes are, 
firmly hammering together the plates, 
filled up with the above-named pickle. 

The finest Japanese brass consists i 
10 parts copper and 8 parts zinc, and 
called siachu. The bell metal kara kan 
is composed of copper 10 parts, tin 1 
parts, iron 0.5 part, and zinc 1.5 .parts 
The copper is first f used,_ then the 
maining metals are added m rotation. 

GERMAN SILVER OR ARGENTAN. 

The composition of this alloy rant 
considerably, but from the adjoined fij 
ures an average may be found wtac 
will represent, approximately, the norms 
composition: 

rn-nner . . • 50 to 66 parts 

S£ p e per 19 to SI parts 

Nickel*'.'.'.... 13 to 18 parts 
The properties of the different kinds, 
such as Jheir colc= ductility, fusibility, 



aft 



vary with the proportions of the 
single metals. For making spoons, forks, 
cups, candlesticks, etc., the most suitable 
Proportions are 50 parts of copper, 25 of 
S and 25 of nickel. This metal has 
a beautiful blue-white color, and does 
not tarnish easily. . , T 

German silver is sometimes so brittle 
that a spoon, if allowed to fall upon the 
floor, will break; this, of course, indicates 
faulty composition. But the following 
table will show how the character ot the 
alloy changes with the varying percent- 
age of the metals composing it:

MAGNETIC ALLOYS. 

Alloys which can be magnetized n 
strongly are composed of copper, man 
ganese, and aluminum, the quantities o 
manganese and aluminum being pro 
portional to their atomic weights (55.0 t 
27.1, or about 2 to 1). The maximu 
magnetization increases rapidly wit 
increase of manganese, but alloys eon 
taining much manganese are exceedingl 
brittle and cannot be wrought. Th 
highest practicable proportion of man 
ganese at present is 24 per cent. 

These magnetic alloys were studied h 
Ilensler, Ilaupt, and Starck f and Gum 
lich has recently examined them at th 
Physikaliseh - technische Iteichsanstalt 
with very remarkable and interesting re 
suits. 

The two alloys examined were com 
posed as follows: 

Alloy I.— Copper 61.5 per cent; man 
ganese, 23.5 per cent, aluminum, 15 pe 
cent; lead, 0.1 per cent, with traces of iro 
and silicon. . 

Alloy II.— Copper, 67.7 per .cent 
manganese, 20.5 per cent; aluminum 
10.7 per cent; lead, 1.2 per cent, wit 
traces of iron and silicon. 

Alloy II could be worked ™£out dif- 
ficulty, but alloy I was so brittle hat it 
broke under the hammer. A bar 7 inches 
long and i inch thick was obtained by 
grinding. This broke in two during the 
g^surfments, but, fortunately wjhou 
invalidating them. Such » i mater aJ

wholly, cured by prolonged heating 
Another singular phenomenon 
exhibited by both of these alloys. When 
a bar of iron is magnetized by an electric 
current, it acquires its full magnetic 
strength almost instantaneously on trie 
closure of the circuit. The magnet! c 
allovs, on the contrary, do not attain 
their full magnetization for several min- 
utes. In some of the experiments a 
gradual increase was observed even after 
the current had been flowing five minutes 
In magnetic strength alloy I proved 
far superior to alloy II, which con- 
tained smaller proportions of manga- 
nese and aluminum. Alloy I showed 
magnetic strengths up to 4.5 kilogauss, 
while the highest magnetization ob- 
tained with alloy II was only 1.9 kilo- 
gauss. But even alloy II may be called 
strongly magnetic, for its maximum mag- 
netization is about one-tenth that of good 
wrought i yn" fl s to 20 M°B auss )- or 
one- sixth that of cast iron (10 to 12 
kilogauss). Alloy I is nearly equal in 
magnetic properties to nickel, which can 
be magnetized up to about 5 kilogauss. 

MANGANESE ALLOYS: 

Manganese bronze is a bronze de- 
prived of its oxide by an admixture of 
manganese. The manganese is used as 
copper manganese containing 10 to 30 
per cent manganese and added to the 
bronze to the amount of 0.5 to 2 per cent. 

Manganese Copper.— The alloys of 
copper with manganese have a beauti- 
ful silvery color, considerable ductility, 
great hardness and tenacity, and are 
more readily fusible than ordinary 
bronze. A special characteristic is that 
they exactly fill out the molds, with- 
out the formation of blowholes, and pre- 
sent no difficulties in casting. 

Cupromanganese is suitable for many 
purposes for which nothing else but 
bronze can advantageously be used, and 
ttie cost of its production is no greater 
tban that of genuine bronze. In pre- 
paring the alloy, the copper is used in the 
iorm of fine g-ains, obtained by pouring 
melted copper into cold water. These 
copper grains are mixed with the dry 
oxide of manganese, and the mixture put 
? rucible holding about 66 pounds, 
enough space must be left in the cruci- 
al %£ ™ a tW ck cover of charcoal, 
as tne manganese oxidizes easily. The 
"ucble is pl aced in a weU-drawing 



wind furnace and subjected to a 
white heat. The oxide of mangan - 8 
completely reduced to manganese w fi ? 
at once combines with the cop per L f ' 
an alloy. In order to prevent, as fa 01 
possible, the access of air to the fi* 9,8 
mass, it is advisable to cover the cruc^n 8 
with a lid which has an aperture in Jl 
center for the escape of the carbon- 
oxide formed during the reduction 

When the reduction is complete anrf 
the metals fused, the lid is removed a 1 
the contents of the crucible stirred win, 
an iron rod, in order to make the allov 
as homogeneous as possible. By re 
peated remelting of the cupromanganese 
a considerable quantity of the man- 
ganese is reconverted into oxide; : t 3" 
therefore, advisable to make the easts 
directly from the crucible. When soured 
out, the alloy rapidly solidifies, &ud re* 
sembles in appearance good German 
silver. Another reason for avoiding re- 
melting is that the crucible is strongly 
attacked by the cupromanganese, and 
can be used but a few times. 

The best kinds of cupromanganese 
contain between 10 and 30 per cent of 
manganese. They have a beautiful 
white color, are hard, tougher than cop- 
per, and can be worked under the ham- 
mer or with rolls. Some varieties of 
cupromanganese which are especially 
valuable for technical purposes are given

Speculum Metal.— Alloys consisting 
of 2 party of copper and I of tin can 
k e very brilliantly polished, and will 
serve for mirrors. Good speculum metal 
should have a very fine-grained fracture, 
should be white and very hard, the high- 
est degree of polish depending upon these 
qualities. A composition to meet these 
requirements must contain at least 35 to 
36 per cent of copper. Attempts have 
Tequently been made to increase the 
hardness of speculum metal by additions 
of nickel, antimony, and arsenic. With 
the exception of nickel, these substances 
have the effect of causing the metal to 
lose its high luster easily, any consid- 
erable quantity of arsenic in particular 
having this effect. 
The real speculum metal seems to be 
combination of the formula Cu^Sn, 
composed of copper 68.21 per cent, tin 
31.7. An alloy of this nature is some- 
times separated from ordnance bronze 
hy incorrect treatment, causing the so- 
called tin spots; but this has not the pure 
white color which distinguishes the spec- 
ulum metal containing 31.5 per cent of tin. 
By increasing the percentage of copper 
the color gradually shades into yellow; 
with a larger amount of tin into blue. It 
is dangerous to increase the tin too much, 
as this changes the other properties of the 
alloy, and it becomes too brittle to be 
worked. Below is a table showing differ- 
ent compositions of speculum metal. The 
standard alloy is undoubtedly the best.

PALLADIUM ALLOYS. 

f\~ A P al , l ?y of palladium 24 parts 
go d 80, is white, hard as steel, unchange- 
able in the air, and can, like the other 
alloys of palladium, be used for dental 

purposes. 

II. —Palladium 6 parts, gold 18, sil 
yer 11, and copper 13, gives a reddish 
brown, hard, and very fine-graiue 
alloy, suitable for the bearings of pivots 
in clock works. 

The alloys of most of the other plati 
num metals, so called, are little used o 
account of their rarity and costliness. 
Iridium and rhodium give great hardnes 
to steel, but the commercial rhodhr 
and iridium steel, so called, frequentl 
contains not a trace of either. The alio 
of iridium with osmium has great hard 
ness and resistance and is recommende 
for pivots, fine instruments, and poin* 
of ship compasses. 

Palladium Silver. — This alloy, cor 
posed of 9 parts of palladium and 1 o 
silver, is used almost exclusively for de 
tal purposes, and is well suited to th 
manufacture of artificial teeth, as it do 
not oxidize. An alloy even more fre 
quently used than this consists of plati 
num 10 parts, palladium 8, and gold 6. 

Palladium Bearing Metal. — This alio 
is extremely hard, and is used instead 
jewel bearings in watches. It is com 
posed of palladium £4 parts, gold 7 
silver 44, copper 92. 

PLATINUM ALLOYS. 

Platinum has usually been alloye 
with silver in goldsmith's work, % part 
silver to 1 of platinum being taken t 
form the favorite "platinum silver. 
The object has been to produce an alio 
having a white appearance, which can b 
polished, and at the same time has 
W melting point. In addition to tn 
platinum alloy the following are w 

known: , .. „;

last-named alloy is extensively used for 
ornaments, likewise alloy V. 

V Ten parts platinum, 60 parts 

nickel, and 220 parts brass, or 2 parts 
platinum, 1 part nickel and silver re- 
spectively, 2 parts brass, arid 5 parts 
copper; this also gives a golden-yellow 
color. . „ 

VI. — For table utensils a favorite alloy 
is composed of 1 part platinum, 100 parts 
nickel, and 10 parts tin. Articles made 
of the latter alloy are impervious to at- 
mospheric action and keep their polish 
for a long time. Pure white platinum 
alloys have for some time been used in 
dental work, and they have also proved 
serviceable for jewelry. 

VII. — A mixture of 30 parts platinum, 
10 parts gold, and 3 parts silver, or 7 
parts platinum, 2 parts gold, and 3 parts 
silver. 

VIII. — For enameled articles: Plati- 
num, 35 parts; silver, 65 parts. First 
fuse the silver, then add the platinum 
in the spongy form, A good solder for 
this is platinum 80 parts, copper 20 
parts. 

. IX. — For pens: Platinum, 4 parts; 
silver, 3 parts; copper, 1 part. 

Platinum Gold.— Small quantities of 
platinum change the characteristics of 
gold in many respects. With a small 
percentage the color is noticeably lighter 
than that of pure gold, and the alloys are 
extremely elastic; alloys containing more 
than 20 per cent of platinum, however, 
almost entirely lose their elasticity. The 
melting point of the platinum-gold alloy 
is high, and alloys containing 70 per cent 
ot platinum can be fused only in the 
W^yf o£ o*ykydrogen gas, like platinum

Cooper's Pen Metal. — This alloy is 
especially well adapted to the manufac- 
ture of pens, on account of its great hard- 
ness, elasticity, and power of resistance 
to atmospheric influences, and would 
certainly have superseded steel if it were 
possible to produce it more cheaply than 
is the case. The compositions most fre- 
quently used for pen metal are coppei 
1 part, platinum 4, and silver 3; or, 
copper 21, platinum 50, and silver 30. 

Pens have been manufactured, con- 
sisting of several sections, each of a dif- 
ferent alloy, suited to the special purpose 
of the part. Thus, for instance, Wj 
sides of the pen are made of the elastic 
composition just described; the upp 
part is of an alloy of silver and P Mll '"Z 
and the point is made either of minute tc. 
rubies or of an extremely hard a no 
osmium and iridium, joined to tJie I 
of the pen by melting in the U&r& g

construction of such instruments, the

into account, since the cost of the labor 
in their manufacture so far exceeds this. 

PEWTER. 

This is an alloy of tin and lead only, 
or of tin with antimony and copper. 
The first is properly called pewter. 
Three varieties are known in trade: 

I (Plate Pewter). — From tin, 7S per 
cent; antimony, 7 per cent; bismuth and 
copper, of each 2 per cent; fused to- 
gether. Used to make plates, teapots, 
etc. Takes a fine polish. 

II (Triple Pewter).— From tin, 79 
per cent; antimony, 15 per cent; lead, 
(j per cent; as the last. Jsed for inifiOT 
articles, syringes, tovs, etc. 

III (Ley Pewter).— From tin, 80 
^>er cent; lead, 20 per cent. Used for 
measures, inkstands, etc. 

According to the report of a French 
commission, pewter containing more 
than 18 parts of lead to 82 parts of tin is 
unsafe for measures for wine and similar 
(iquurs, and, indeed, for any other uten- 
sils exposed to contact with food or 
beverages. The legal specific gravity 
of pewter in France is 7. 764; if it be 
greater, it contains an excess of lead, 
and is liable to prove poisonous. The 
proportions of these rnetals may be ap- 
proximately determined from the specific 
gravity; but correctly only by an assay 
for the purpose.

it consists of 38.33 parts of silver an 
66.66 parts of aluminum. Its adva

the alloys of copper and silver. 
. VII.— This is a hard alloy which h 
been found very useful for the operati 
levers of certain machines, such as ' 
spacing lever of a typewriter. The me 
now generally used for this purpose 
the various typewriter companies is "al 
milium silver," or "silver metal." T 
proportions are given as follows: 

Copper. 57.00 

Nickel 20.00 

Zinc , 20 . 00 

Aluminum... 3.00 

This alloy when used on typewriti 
machines is nickel-plated for the sake 
the first appearance, but so far as corr 
sion is concerned, nickeling is unnece 
sary. The alloy is stiff and strong a 
cannot be bent to any extent witho 
breaking, especially if the percentage 
aluminum is increased to 3.5 per cen 
it casts free from ninholes and bio 
holes; the liquid metal completely fi 
the mold, giving sharp, clean casting 
true to pattern; its cost is not great 
than brass; its color is silver whit 
and its hardness makes it susceptible 
a high polish. 

Arsenic. — Alloys which contain srna 
quantities of arsenic are very ductn 
have a beautiful white color, and wer 
formerly used in England in the ma 
ufacture of tableware. They are no 
however, suitable for this purpose, o 
account of the poisonous character 
the arsenic. They are composed usuall 
of 49 parts of silver, 49 of copper, and 
of arsenic.

formed, as the following French com-

The whitening of alloys of silver and 
copper is best accomplished by anneal- 
ing the alloy until it turns black on the 
surface. Cool in a mixture of 20 parts, by 
weight, of concentrated sulphuric acid to 
1,000 parts of distilled water and leave 
therein for some time. In place of the 
sulphuric acid, 40 parts of potassium 
bisulphate may be used per 1,000 parts 
of liquid. Repeat the process if neces- 
sary. 

Copper, Silver, and Cadmium Alloys. 
—Cadmium added to silver alloys gives 
great flexibility and ductility, without 
affecting the white color; these proper- 
ties are valuable in the manufacture of 
silver-plated ware and wire. The pro- 
portions of the metals vary in these al- 
loys'. Some of the most important vari- 
eties are given below.

In, preparing these alloys, the great 
volatility of cadmium must be taken 
into account. It is customary to pre- 
pare first the alloy of silver and copper, 
and add the cadmium, which, as in the 
case of the alloys of silver and zinc, must 
be wrapped in paper. After putting it 
in the mass is quickly stirred, and the 
alloy poured immediately into the molds. 
1 his is the surest way to prevent the 
volatilization of the cadmium. 

Silver, Copper, Nickel, and Zinc Alloys, 
-incse alloys, from the metals con- 
■med in them, may be characterized as 
'gentan or German silver with a cer-

prepared in Japan which consists at 
equal parts of copper and silver, and 
which is given a beautiful gray color bj 
boiling in a solution of alum, to which 
copper sulphate and verdigris are added. 
The so-called "mokum," also a Japaner 
alloy, is prepared by placing thin plate 
of gold, silver, copper, and the alloy jus 
described over each other and stretch 
ing them under the hammer. The cros 
sections of the thin plates obtained « 
this way show the colors of the different 
metals, which give them a peculiar 
striped appearance. Mokum is prin- 
cipally used for decorations upon goia 
and silver articles.

WHITE METALS. 

The so-called white metals ■ are ,— . 
ployed almost exclusively for bear b • 
(See Anti-friction Metals under AU°p; 
In the technology of mechanics ^ 
curate distinction is made 
different kinds of metals for *

red brass and white metal. 1 D 



effl- 



brass bearings are characterized by great 
hardness and power of resistance, and 
are principally used for bearings of heav- 
ily Wcled and rapidly revolving axles, 
for the axles of large and heavy fly- 
wheels, revolving at great speed, bearings 
of red brass are preferable to white metal, 
though more expensive. 

In°recent years many machinists have 
found it advantageous to substitute for 
the soft alloys generally in use for bear- 
ings a metal almost as hard as the axle 
itself. Phosphor bronze (q. v.) is fre- 
quently employed for this purpose, as it 
can easily be made as hard as wrought 
or cast steel. In this case the metal is 
used in a thin layer, and serves only, 
as it were, to fill out the small interstices 
caused by wear on the axle and bearing, 
the latter being usually made of some 
rather easily fusible alloy of lead and tin. 
Such bearings are very durable, but ex- 
pensive, and can only be used for large 
machines. For small machines, run- 
ning gently and uniformly, white-metal 
bearings are preferred, and do excellent 
work, if the axle is not too heavily loaded. 
For axles which have a high rate of revo- 
lution, bearings made of quite hard 
metals are chosen, and with proper care 
—which, indeed, must be given to bear- 
ings of any material — they will last for a 
long time without needing repair.

ALUMINUM AND ITS TREATMENT 



They may be restored to their 
"''at whiteness in trie following manner: 
? nieise the aluminum articles in a 
boiling bath of caustic potash; nest 
lunge them quickly into nitric acid, 
nnse°and let dry. It must be under- 
took that this method is applicable only 
to pieces entirely of aluminum. 

Decolorized Aluminum. — Gray or un- 
sightly aluminum may be restored to its 
wfiite color by washing with a mixture 
of 30 parts of borax dissolved in 1,000 
parts of water, with a few drops of am- 
monia added. 

Mat Aluminum. — In order to imparl 
to aluminum the appearance of mat 
silver, plunge the article into a hot bath 
composed of a 10-per-cent solution of 
caustic soda saturated with kitchen salt. 
Leave it in the bath for 15 to SO seconds, 
then wash and brush; put back into the 
bath for half a minute, wash anew and 
dry in sawdust. 

To Blacken Aluminum. — I. — The sur- 
face of the sheet to be colored is polished 
with very fine emery powder or finest 
emery cloth. Afler polishing pour a 
thin, layer of olive oil over the surface 
and heat slowly over an alcohol flame. 
Large sheets must, of course, be heated 
in the drying oven. After a short while 
pour on oil again, in order to obtain ab- 
solute uniformity of the coating, and heat 
the plate once more. Under the action 
of the heat the plate turns first brown, 
then black, according to the degrees of 
neat. When the desired coloration has 
been attained, the plate is polished over 
again, after cooling, with a woolen rag 
or soft leather.

ALUMINUM AND ITS 



lTMENT 



rmt have been previously used, that of a 
fine S should be chosen, but it should 
Jot Sve any excess of aluminous matter, 
or it will not permit of the free escape 
of gLS and a£ this being an important 
matter. Besides this, the sand must be 
used as dry as pa* uble c^W* 1 ™^ 
holding against the flow of the metal, 
and having only moderate compression 
in ramming. . . . 

In making the molds it is necessary 
to remember that aluminum has a large 
contraction in cooling, and also that at 
certain temperatures it is very weak and 
tears readily, while all metals shrink 
away from the mold when this is 
whollv outside the casting, but they 
shrink on to cores or portions of the 
mold partly inclosed by metal. Thus, 
if casting a plate or bar of metal, it will 
shrink away from the mold in all direc- 
tions; but if casting a square frame, it 
shrinks away from the outside only, 
while it shrinks on to the central part 
or core. With brass, or iron, or such 
metals, this is not of much importance, 
but with some others, including alumi- 
num, it is of great importance, because 
if the core or inclosed sand will not give 
somewhat with the contraction of the 
metal, torn or fractured castings will be 
the result. Both for outside and inside 
molds, and with cores used with alu- 
minum, the sand should be compressed 
as little as possible, and hard ramming 
must in every case be avoided, particu- 
larly where the metal surrounds the sand. 
The molds must be very freely vented, 
and not only at the joint of the mold, 
but by using the vent wire freely through 
the body of the mold itself; in fact, for 
brass the venting would be considered 
axcessive. With aluminum it is, how- 
ever, necessary to get the air off as rapid- 
ly as possible, because the metal soon 
gets sluggish in the mold, and unless it 
runs up quickly it runs faint at the edges, 
lhe mgates should be wide and of fair 
area, hut need careful making to prevent 
their drawing where they enter the cast- 
ing, the method of doing this being 
known to most molders. ' 

If it is considered desirable to use a 
all \ mad , e "U P facing sand for the 
molds where the metal is of some thiok- 

w!nV iwf of . 3 liUle P ea or bean m( =al 
will be all that is necessary. To use this,

The molds should not be sleeked

very smooth face is required on +i & 
castings. Preferably, however tl, 
of the brush even should be „£gf 
Patterns tor aluminum should be k 
smooth and well varnished. ^ 
In melting the metal it is necessary tn 
use a plumbago crucible which is C W 
and which has not been used for oth 
metals. Clay or silica crucibles are not 
good for this metal, especially silica on 
account of the metal absorbing silicon 
and becoming hard under some condi- 
tions of melting. A steady fire is neces- 
sary, and the fuel should reach only 
about halfway up the crucible, as it is 
not desirable to overheat the crucible or 
metal. The metal absorbs heat for 
some time and then fuses with some ra- 

Eidity, hence the desirability of a steady 
eat; and as the metal should be poured 
when of a claret color under the film of 
oxide which forms on the surface, too 
rapid a heating is not advisable. The 
molding should always be well in ad- 
vance of the pouring, because the metal 
should be used as soon as it is ready; for 
not only is waste caused, but the metal 
loses condition if kept in a molten state 
for long periods. The metal should be 
poured rapidly, but steadily, and whea 
cast up there should not be a large head 
of metal left on top of the runner. In 
fact, it is rather a disadvantage to leave 
a large head, as this tends to draw rather 
than to feed the casting. , 
With properly prepared molds, ana 
careful melting, fluxes are not required, 
but ground cryolite— a fluoride of sodl,1I J 
and aluminum— is sometimes used 
increase the fluidity of the metal, in 
using this, a few ounces according ™
