logwood extract (80 per cent) with 3 
parts of spirit previously mingled with 1 
part of hydrochloric acid, maintaining a

of potassium chromate in 15 parts of 
boiling water; to this add 10 parts of 
hydrochloric acid, and pour this mixture, 
after raising the temperature to about 
86° F., very slowly and with constant 
stirring into the kettle. Then heat the 
whole to 185° F. This mass, which has 
now assumed the nature of an extract, is 
stirred a little longer, and next 15 parts of 
dextrin mixed with 10 parts of fine 
white earth (white bole) are added. 
The whole is well stirred throughout. 
Transfer the mass from the kettle into a 
crusher, where it is thoroughly worked 
through. 

PRINTING INKS. 

Black printing inks owe their color to 
finely divided carbon made from lamp- 
black, pine-wood, rosin oil, etc., ac- 
cording to the quality of the ink desired. 
The finest inks are made from flame- 
lampblack. There are, however, cer- 
tain requirements made of all printing 
inks alike, and these arc as follows: 
The ink must be a thick and homoge- 
neous liquid, it must contain no solid 
matter but finely divided carbon, and 
every drop when examined microscopic- 
ally must appear as a clear liquid con- 
taining black grains uniformly distrib- 
uted. 

The consistency of a printing ink must 
be such that it passes on to the printing 
rollers at the proper rate. It will be 



obvious that various consistencies 
demanded according to the nature of \v 
machine used by the printer. F or 
rotary machine which prints many thoif 
sands of copies an hour a much tluW" 
ink will be necessary than that requiJJ 
for art printing or for slow presses a 
regards color, ordinary printing i^L 
should be a pure black. For economy's 
sake, however, newspaper printers often 
use an ink so diluted that it does not look 
deep black, but a grayish black, espe- 
cially in large type. 

The question of the time that the ink 
takes to dry on the paper is a very impor, 
tant one, especially with ink used for 
printing newspapers which are folded 
and piled at one operation. If then the 
ink does not dry very quickly, the whole 
impression smudges and "sets off" so 
much that it becomes illegible in places. 
Although it is essential to have a quick 
drying ink for this purpose, it, is danger- 
ous to go too far, for a too quickly drying 
ink would make the paper stick to the 
forms and tear it. A last condition which 
must be fulfilled by a good printing ink 
is that it must be easy of removal from 
the type, which has to be used again. 

No one composition will answer every 
purpose and a number of different inks 
are required. Makers of printing inks 
are obliged, therefore, to work from de- 
finite recipes so as to be able to turn 
out exactly the same ink again and again. 
They make newspaper ink for rotary 
presses, book-printing inks, half-tone 
inks, art inks, etc. As the recipes have 
been attained only by long, laborious, 
and costly experiments, it is obvious that 
the makers are not disposed to commu- 
nicate them, and the recipes that are 
offered and published must be l° okta 
upon with caution, as many of t hem * 
of little or no value. In the recip es 
given below for printing mks, the oi

m Ry S the most time-hunored method, 
linseed oil was very slowly heated over 
in open fire until" it ignited. It was 
allowed to burn for a time and then ex- 
tinguished by putting a lid on the pot. 
Tn this wav a liquid was obtained of a 
j"k brown or black color with par- 
ticles of carbon, and with a consistency 
varving with the period of heating, being 
thicker, the longer the heating was con- 
tinued. If necessary, the liquid was 
then thinned with unboiled, or only very 
slightly boiled, linseed oil. Lampblack 
in the proper quantity was added and the 
mixture was finally rubbed up on a stone 
in small quantities at a time to make it 
uniform. 

Boiling the Linseed Oil.— This process, 
although it goes by the name of boiling, 
is not so in the proper sense of the word, 
hut a heating having for its object an 
initial oxidation of the oil, so that it will 
dry better. Linseed oil is a type of the 
drying oils, those which when exposed m 
thin coats to the air absorb large quan- 
tities of oxygen and are thereby coh- 
verted into tough, solid sheets having 
properties very similar to those of soit 
India rubber. The process goes on much 
faster with the aid of heat than at the or- 
dinary temperature, and the rate _ at 
which the boiled oil will dry in the ink 
can be exactly regulated by beating it for 
a longer or shorter time. Prolonged 
heating gives an oil which will dry very 
quickly on exposure in thin coats to the 
air, the shorter the heating the more 
slowly will the ink afterwards made with 
the oil dry, , 

Linseed oil must always be boiled, m 
vessels where it has plenty of room, as 
the oil soon swells up and it begins to de- 
compose so energetically at a particular 
temperature that there is considerable 
risk of its boiling over and catching fire. 
Various contrivane.es have been thought 
out for boiling large quantities of the oil 
with safety, such as pans with an outlet 
pipe in the side, through which the oil 
escapes when it rises too high instead of 
over the edge of the pan, and fires built 
on a trolley running on rails, so that they 
can at once be moved from under the 
pan if there is any probability of the 
fatter boiling over. The best apparatus 
for preparing thickened linseed oil is 
undoubtedly one in which the oil offers a 
very large surface to the air, and on that 
account requires to be moderately heated 



only. The oil soon becomes very thick 
under these conditions and if necessary 
can be diluted to any required consist- 
ency with unboiled oil. 

In boiling linseed oil down to the 
proper thickness by the old method there 
are two points demanding special atten- 
tion. One is the liability of the oil to boil 
over, and the other consists in the devel- 
opment of large quantities of vapor, most- 
ly of acroleine, which have amostpower- 
ful and disagreeable smell, and an intense 
action upon the eyes. The attendant 
must be protected from these fumes, and 
the boiling must therefore be done where 
there is a strong draught to take the 
fumes as fast as they are produced. 
There are various contrivances to cope 
with boiling over.

indigo and Prussian blue, each 5 drachms;

Toning Black Inks. — Printers' ink 
consisting solely of purified^ lampbhie 
and vehicle give, of course, impression 
which are pure black. It is, however 
well known that a black which has to 
practiced eye a tinge of blue in it loo 
much better than a pure black. T 
make such an ink many makers mix th 
lampblack with a blue pigment, which is 
added in very fine powder before the nrst 
grinding. Prussian blue is the pigment 
usually chosen and gives very attractive 
results. Prussian blue is, however not 
a remarkable stable substance, and is 
very apt to turn brown from the forma- 
tion of ferric oxide. Hence an ink made 
with Prussian blue, although it may look 
very fine at first, often assumes a dull 
brown hue in the course oi time, ex- 
cellent substitutes for Prussian blue are 
to be found in the Induline blues. 1 hese

them do not change color As pure , in

INKS FOR STAMP PADS. 

The ink used on vulcanized rubber 



1IIPS should be such that when ap 
pHeTto a suitable pad it remams sui£- 
ciently fluid to adhere to the stamp. 



the same time the fluidity should cease 
by thcTime the stamp is pressed upon an 
absorbing surface such as paper, *or- 
meriy these inks were made by rubbing 
up pigments in fat to a paste. Such inks 
c£i hardly be prevented, however, from 
making impressions surrounded by a 
Sea y markcaused by the fat spreading 
in the pores of the paper. . Now, mosL 
damping inks are made without grease 
and a properly prepared stamping ink 
contains nothing but g ycerine and coal- 
tar dye. As nearly all these dyes dis- 
solve in hot glycerine the process ot 
manufacture is simple enough. J. he 
dye, Euchsine, methyl violet, water blue, 
emerald green, etc., is put into a thin 
porcelain dish over which concentrated 
glycerine is poured, and the whole is 
heated to nearly 212° F. with constant 
stirring. It is important to use no more 
glycerine than is necessary to keep the 
dye dissolved when the ink is cold. If 
the mass turns gritty on cooling it must 
be heated up with more glycerine till 
solution is perfect. 

In dealing with coal-tar dyes insoluble 
in glycerine, or nearly so, dissolve them 
first in the least possible quantity of 
strong, hot alcohol. Then add the glyc- 
erine and heat till the spirit is evapo- 
rated. 

To see whether the ink is properly 
made spread some of it on a strip of 
cloth and try it with a rubber stamp. 
On paper, the separate letters must be 
quite sharp and distinct. If they run 
at the edges there is too much glycerine 
in the ink and more dye must be added 
to it. If, on the contrary, the impres- 
sion is indistinct and weak, the ink is too 
thick and must be diluted by carefully 
adding glycerine. 

Aniline colors are usually employed 
as the tinting agents. The following is 
a typical formula, the product being a 
black ink: 

1. — Nigrosin S parts 

Water 15 parts 



Alcohol 15 parts 

Glycerine 70 p arts 

Dissolve the nigrosin in the alcohol 
add the glycerine previously mixed with 
the water, and rub well together. 

Nigrosin is a term applied to several 
compounds of the same series which 
differ in solubility. In the place of 
these compounds it is probable that a 
mixture would answer to produce black 
as suggested by Hans Wilder for making 
writing ink. His formula for the mix- 
ture is: 

II. — Methyl violet 3 parts 

Bengal green 5 parts 

Bismarck green 4 parts 

A quantity of this mixture should be 
taken equivalent to the amount of nigro- 
sin directed. These colors are freely 
soluble in water, and yield a deep green- 
ish-black solution. 

The aniline compound known as 
brilliant green answers in place of Bengal 
green. As to the permanency of color of 
this or any aniline ink, no guarantee is 
offered. There are comparatively tew 
coloring substances that _ can be con- 
sidered permanent even in a qualified 
sense. Among these, charcoal takes a 
foremost place. Lampblack remains 
indefinitely unaltered. This, ground 
very finely with glycerine, would yield 
an 'ink which would perhaps prove serv- 
iceable in stamping; but it would be 
liable to rub off to a greater extent than 
soluble colors which penetrate the paper 
more or less. Perhaps castor oil *ouW 
prove a better vehicle for insoluble dj 
matters. Almost any, aniline, coloi

Color Stamps for Rough Paper. — It 

has hitherto been impossible to get a 
satisfactory application for printing with 
rubber stamps on rough paper. Fatty 
vehicles are necessary for such paper, 
and they injure the India rubber. It is 
said, however, that if the rubber is first 
soaked in a solution of glue, and then in 
one of tannin, or bichromate of potash, 
it becomes impervious to the oils or fats. 
Gum arabic can be substituted for the 
glue.

TYPEWRITER RIBBON INKS. 

I, —Take vaseline (petrolatum) of high 
boiling point, melt it on a water bath or 
slow fire, and incorporate by constant 
stirring as much lamp or powdered drop 
black as it will take up without becom- 
ing granular. If the vaseline remains 
in excess, the print is liable to have a 
greasy outline; if the color is in excess, 
the print will not be clear. Remove the 
mixture from the fire, and while it is 
cooling mix equal parts of petroleum, 
benzine, and rectified oil of turpentine, m 
which dissolve the fatty ink, introduced 
in small portions, by constant agitation. 
The volatile solvents should be in such 
quantity that the fluid ink is of the con- 
sistence of fresh oil paint. One secret of 
success lies in the proper application of 
the ink to the ribbon. Wind the ribbon 
on a piece of cardboard, spread on a 
table several layers of newspaper, then 
unwind the ribbon in such lengths as 
may be most convenient, and lay it flat 
on the paper. Apply the ink, after agi- 
tation, by means of a soft brush, and 
rub it well into the interstices of the rib- 
bon with a toothbrush. Hardly any ink 
should remain visible on the surface. 
For colored inks use Prussian blue, red 
lead, etc., and especially the aniline 
colors.

COPYING INK. 

This is usually prepared by adding a 
Htde /ugar to ordinary black ink, which 
or thTs purpose should be very rich m 

1 a nd preferably made galls pre^ 
pared by heat. Writing executed with 
fbis hik may be copied within he space 
* 5 or 6 hours, by passing it through a 
copvin" pre^ in contact with thin un- 
S?d paper, .lightly damped, enclosed 
between 2 sheets of thick oiled or waxed 
ItZl when a reversed transcript will be 
Sbtained, which will read in proper order 
when the back of the copy a turned up- 
wards. In the absence of a press a copy 
may be taken, when the ink » good and 
Se writing very recent, by rolling the 
slieets duly arranged on a ruler, over the 

u face of a flat, smooth table, employing 
as much force as possible, and avoiding 
any slipping or crumbling of the paper. 
Another method is to pass a warm fla - 
iron over the paper laid upon the writ- 
ing. The following proportions are em- 
ployed: 

J_ Sugar candy or lump sugar, 1 
ounce; or molasses or moist sugar, L t 
ounces; rich black ink, I J pints; dis- 
solve. 

II.— Malt wort, 1 pint; evaporate it to 
the consistence of a syrup, and then dis- 
solve it in good black ink, 11 pints. 

HI.— Solazza juice, 3 ounces; mild 
ale, \ pint; dissolve, strain, and triturate 
with" lampblack (previously heated to 
dull redness in a covered vessel), \ ounce ] 
when the mixture is complete, add of 
strong black, 14 pints; mix well, and m 

2 or 3 hours decant the clear. 
After making the above mixtures, 

they must be tried with a common steel 
pen, and if they do not flow freely, some 
more unprepared ink should be added 
until they are found to do so. 

Alizarine Blue.— In 20 parts of fuming 
sulphuric acid dissolve 5 parts of indigo, 
and to the solution add 100 parts of ex- 
tract of aqueous myrobalous and 10.5 
parts iron filings or turning shavings. 
Finally add: 

Gum arabic 1.5 parts 

Sugar 7. 5 parts 

Sulphuric acid, 66° 

B , 10.5 parts 

Aniline blue 1-5 parts 

Carbolic acid 0.5 parts 

Mirobalan extract to make 1,000 
parts. 

This ink v/hen first used has a bluish 
tint, afterwards becoming black. 

Alizarine Green.— In 100 parts of 
aqueous extract of gall apples dissolve 



Iron sulphate 30 parts 

Copper sulphate 0.5 parts 

Sulpnurie acid 2 parts 

Sugar 8 parts 

Wood vinegar, recti-

Copying Ink for Copying Without a 
Press. — An ordinary thin-paper copying 
book may be used, and the copying done 
by transference. It is only necessary 
to place the page of writing m the letter 
book, just as one would use a leaf of blot- 
ting paper. The superfluous ink that 
would go into the blotting paper goes on 
to the leaf of the letter book, and show- 
ing through the thin paper gives on the 
other side of the leaf a perfect transcrip' 
of the letter. Any excess of ink on th 
page, either of the letter or of the copy 
mg paper, is removed by placing a shee 
of blotting paper between them, and run 
ning one's hand firmly over the whole i 
the ordinary manner. This ready tran 
scription is accomplished by using in 1 
which dries slowly. Obviously the m 
must dry sufficiently slowly for the 
characters at the top of a page of writing 
to remain wet when the last line is being 
written, while it must dry sufficiently to 
preclude any chance of the copied page 
being smeared while subsequent pages 
are being covered. The drying must 
also be sufficiently rapid to prevent the 
characters "setting off," as printers term 
it from one page on to another alter 
folding. The formula for the requisite 
ink is very simple: . . 

Reduce by evaporation 10 volumes of 
any good ink to 6, then add 4 volume, 
of llj cerine. Or manufacture some ink 
of nearly double strength, and add to any 
quantity of it nearly an equal volume of 
glycerine.

The Use of Hydrocyanic Acid Gas for 
Exterminating Household Insects. — Re- 
cent successful applications of hydro- 
cyanic acid gas for the extermination of 
insects infecting greenhouse plants have 
suggested the use of the same remedy for 
household pests. It is now an established 
fact that 1J grains of 98 per cent pure 
cyanide of potassium volatilized m a 
cubic foot of space, will, if allowed to 
remain for a period of not less than 3 
hours, kill all roaches and similar in- 
sects. 

It may be stated that a dwelling, 
>ffice, warehouse, or any building may 
je economically cleared of all pests, 
provided that the local conditions will 
permit the use of this gas. It probably 
Would be dangerous to fumigate a 
building where groceries, dried fruits, 
meats, or prepared food materials of any 
kind are stored. Air containing more 
than 25 per cent of the gas is inflam- 
lable; therefore it would be well to put 
all fire in an inclosure before fumi- 
gating. Hydrocyanic acid, in all its 
torms, is one of the most violent poisons 
mown and no neglect should attend its 
se. J. here is probably no sure remedy

load of any of the higher animals,

dose and a shorter period of exposure ate 
required to kill mice than for roaches and 
household insects generally, and it read 
ily follows^ that the larger animals and 
human bemgs would be more quicklv 
overcome than mice, since a smalle 
supply of pure air would be required to 
sustain life in mice, and small opening 
are more numerous than large ones 

The materials employed and the meth- 
od of procedure are as follows: After 
ascertaining the cubic content of the 
inclosure, provide a glass or stoneware 
(not metal) vessel of 2 to 4 gallons capac- 
ity for each 5,000 cubic feet of space to 
be fumigated. Distribute the jars ac- 
cording to the space, and run a smooth 
cord from each jar to a common point 
near an outside door where they may all 
be fastened; support the cord above the 
jar by means of the back of a chair or 
other convenient object in such a position 
that when the load^ of cyanide of potas- 
sium is attached it will hang directly 
over the center of the jar. Next weigh 
out upon a piece of soft paper about 17 
ounces of 98 per cent pure cyanide of 
potassium, using a large pair of forceps 
tor handling the lumps; wrap up and 
place in a paper bag and tie to the end of 
the cord over the jar. After the load 
for each jar has been similarly provided, 
it is well to test the working of the cords 
to see that they do not catch or bind. 
Then remove the jar a short distance 
from under the load of cyanide and place 
in it a little more than a quart of water, 
to which slowly add 1A pints of commer- 
cial sulphuric acid, stirring freely. The 
action of the acid will bring the temper- 
ature of the combination almost to the 
boiling point. Replace the jars beneath 
the bags of cyanide, spreading a large 
sheet of heavy paper on the floor to catch 
any acid that may possibly fly over the 
edge of the jar when the cyanide is 
dropped, or as a result of the violent 
chemical action which follows. Close 
all outside openings and open up the 
interior of the apartment as much as 
possible, in order that the full strength of 
the gas may reach the hiding places of 
the insects. See that all entrances are 
Jacked or guarded on the outside to pre- 
vent persons entering; then leave the 
budding, releasing the cords as you go. 
lhe gas will all be given off in a few 
minutes, and should remain in the 

Wi ing M least 3 hours - 

When the sulphuric acid comes in 

contact with the cvanide of potassium 

the result is the formation of sulphate of 

potash, which remains in the. jar, and the 

Hydrocyanic acid is liberated and es-

„ B fnto the air. The chemical action 
ffffySSit i to cause a sputtering, and 
LnnentlT particles of the acid are 
Sn over?he sides of the jar; this may 
? € prevented by supporting a sheet of 
K/rfaper over the ar by means of a

\Jsed the paper will descend with the 
^nide and remain at rest on the top of 
Iffr but will not prevent the easy 
lleent of the cyanide into the acid 
The weight of this paper will in no way 
iuterfere with the escape of the gas 

At the end of the time required for 
* -J+^t, the windows and doors 
Soufd be "opined from the outside and 
the gas allowed to escape before anyone 
enters the building. A general cleaning 
S ould follow, as the insects leave .their 
h d ng places and, dying on the floors 
are easily swept up and burned I he 
sulphate of potash remaining in the jars 
L poisonous and should be immcdia ely 
huned and the jars themselves felled 
S earTi or ashes. No food that -has 
remained during fumigation, should be 
used, and thorough ventilation should 
be maintained for several hours. After 
one of these experiments it was noted 
that ice water which bad remained m a 
closed cooler had taken up the gas, and 
had both the odor and taste of cyanide. 

For dwellings one fumigation each 
year would be sufficient, but for storage 
houses it may be necessary to make an 
application every 3 or 4 months to keep 
them entirely free from insect pests. 
The cost of materials for one application 
is about 50 cents for each 5,000 cubic 
feet of space to be treated. The cyanide 
of potassium can be purchased at about 
35 cents per pound, and the commercial 
sulphuric acid at about 4 cents per pound. 
The strength of the dose may be in- 
creased and the time of exposure some- 
what shortened, but this increases the 
cost and does not do the work so thor- 
oughly. In no case, however, should the 
dose remain less than 1 hour. 

The application of this method ot 
controlling household insects and pests 
Generally is to be found in checking the 
advance of great numbers of some par- 
ticular insect, or in eradicating them 
where they have become thoroughly 
established. This method will be found 
very advantageous in clearing old build- 
ings and ships of cockroaches.

AHT DESTROYERS: 

A most efficacious means of getting nd 
ftX is spraying their resorts with pe- 
SjJSSi ff/ ommo.! oil is worth more 
Ifthi? purpose than the refined. Two 
thorough sprayings usually suffice. 
th In afinofres; dressing cases, etc., oil of 
t.,roentine should be employed. Pour 
STS large plate, and. let pon£ 
freely. Tobacco juice is another ertect 
ve agent, but bo A substances have the 
drlwBack of a very penetrating and dis- 

aB S3S wl?e r ; is deadly to ants wherever 
it can be used (as in the garden, or yard 
around the house). So is carbon disul- 
phide injected into the nests by aid of a 
good, big syringe. An emulsion ot pe- 
troleum and water (oil, 1 part; water, 3 
parts) poured on the earth has proven 
very efficacious, when plentifully used 
(say from 1 ounce to 3 ounces to the 
square yard). A similar mixture of cal- 
cium sulphide and water (calcium sul- 
phide, 100 parts; water, 1,000 parts; and 
the white of 1 egg to every quart of water) 
poured into their holes is also effective. 

A weak solution of corrosive sublimate 
is very deadly to ants. Not only does it 
kill them eventually, but it seems to 
craze them before death, so that ants of 
the same nest, after coming into contact 
with the poison, will attack each other 
with the greatest ferocity. 

Where ants select a particular point 
for their incursions it is a good plan to 
surround it with a "fortification" of ob- 
noxious substance. Sulphur has been 
used successfully in this way, and so has 
coal oil. The latter, however, is not a 
desirable agent, leaving a persistent stain 
and odor. 

The use of carbon disulphide is rec- 
ommended to destroy ants' nests on 
lawns. A little of the disulphide is 
poured mto the openings of the hills, 
stepping -on each as it is treated to close 
it up. rhe volatile vapors of the disul- 
phide will penetrate the chambers of the 
nest m every direction, and if sufficient 
has been used will kill not only the adult 
insects hut the larv* as well. A single 
treatment is generally sufficient.

BEDBUG DESTROYERS. 

A good bug killer is benzine, p ure and 
simple, or mixed with a little oil of mirbane 
It evaporates quickly and leaves no stain 
The only trouble is the infianimability 0 f 
its vapor. 

The following is a popular prepara- 
tion: To half a gallon of kerosene oil 
add a quart of spirit of turpentine and an 
ounce of oil of pennyroyal. This mix- 
ture is far less dangerous than benzine, 
The pennyroyal as well as the turpentine 
are not only poisonous but exceedingly 
distasteful to insects of all kinds. The 
kerosene while less quickly fatal to brigs 
than benzine is cheaper and safer, and 
when combined with the other ingre- 
dients becomes as efficient. 

Where the wall paper and wood work 
of a room have become invaded, the 
usual remedy is burning sulphur. To 
be efficient the room must have every 
door, window, crevice, and crack closed. 
The floor should be wet in advance so 
as to moisten the air. A rubber tube 
should lead from the burning sulphur to 
a kev-hole or auger-hole and through i% 
and by aid of a pair of bellows air should 
be blown to facilitate the combustion of 
the sulphur. 

Pastes, —Some housewives are partial 
to corrosive sublimate for bedbugs; but 
it is effective only if the bug eats the poison. 
The corrosive sublimate cannot P^W 
the waxy coat of the insect. But w»J 
much as* people insist on having tin 
few formulas are given.

Kd in many instances it would be pre- 
ferred It ^ possible to make a cold in- 
us on of White hellebore of 25 per cent

vantage of the soap paste is simply to 
Sep tie poisonous substance thoroughly 
Sbuted throughout the mass at all 
rimes The density of the paste can be 
varied to suit. Kerosene oil or turpentine 
could replace 6 ounces or 8 ounces of the 
water in making the paste f*d of 
Jese would make a valuable addition. 

Another paste preparation which will 
meet with hearty recommendation is 
Sue ointment. This ointment, mixed 
with turpentine or kerosene oil, can be 
used to good advantage; especially so as 
the turpentine is so penetrating that both 
it and the mercury have a chance to act 
more effectually. It can be said that 
turpentine will kill the bedbug if the two 
come in contact; and kerosene is not tar 
behindhand in its deadly work.

Turpentine 3 ounces

Liquid Bedbug Preparations.— There 
is no doubt that the liquid form is the 
best to use; unlike a powder, or even a 
paste, it will follow down a crack into 
remote places where bugs hide, and will 
prevent their escape, and it will also kill 
the eggs and nits. The following sub- 
stances are the most employed, and are 
probably the best: Kerosene, turpentine, 
benzine, carbolic acid, corrosive subli- 
mate solution, oil pennyroyal, and strong 
solution of soap. Here are several good 
formulas that can be depended upon: 

I. — Oil of pennyroyal ... 1 drachm 

Turpentine 8 ounces 

Kerosene oil, enough to make 1 

gallon. 

Put up in 8-ounce bottles as a bedbug 
exterminator. 

II. — Oil of eucalyptus ... 1 drachm 
Eucalyptus leaves.. . 1 ounce 

Benzine 2 ounces 

Turpentine 2 ounces 

Kerosene enough to make 16 

ounces. 

Mix the turpentine, benzine, and 
kerosene oil, and macerate the eucalyp- 
tus leaves in it for 24 hours; then strain 
and make up the measure to 1 pint, bav- 
in c; first added the oil of eucalyptus. 



FLY -KILLERS. 

A fly poison that is harmless to man 
may be made from quassia wood as fol- 
lows: 

Quassia 1,000 parts 

Molasses 150 parts 

Alcohol SO parts 

Water 5,750 parts 

Macerate the quassia in 500 parts of 
water for £4 hours, boil for half an hour, 
set aside for 24 hours, then press out the 
liquid. Mix this with the molasses and 
e vaporate to 200 parts. Add the alcohol 
and the remaining 750 parts of water, 
and without filtering, saturate absorbent 
paper with it. 

This being set out on a plate with a 
little water attracts the flies, which are 
killed by partaking of the liquid.

INSECTICIDES FOR PLANTS. 

Two formulas for insecticides with 
•special reference to vermin which 
attack plants: 



I. — Kerosene 

Common soap 
Water. ....... 



2 gallop 
i Pound 
■ ■ 1 gallon 
Heat the solution of soap, add it boil 
ing hot to the kerosene and churn until 
it forms a perfect emulsion, For ~j 
upon scale insects it is diluted with ft 
parts of water; upon other ordinary 
insects with 15 parts of water, and upon 
soft insects, like plant lice, with frotn 2(1 
to 25 parts of water. 

For lice, etc., which attack the roots of 
vines and trees the following is recom- 
mended: 

II. — Caustic soda ,5 pounds 

Rosin . 40 pounds 

Water, a sufficient quantity. 
Dissolve the soda in 4 gallons of water 
by the aid of heat, add the rosin and 
after it is dissolved and while boiling add 
slowly, enough water to make 50 gallons! 
For use, 1 part of this mixture is diluted 
with 10 parts of water and about 5 gal- 
lons of the product poured into a depres- 
sion near the root of the vine or tree. 

For Cochineal Insects. — An emulsion 
for fumagine (malady of orange trees 
caused by the cochineal insect) and other 
diseases caused by insects is as follows: 

Dissolve, hot, 4 parts of black soap in 
15 parts of hot water. Let cool to 104° 
F., and pour in 10 parts of ordinary 
petroleum, shaking vigorously. Thus 
an emulsion of cafe au lait color is ob- 
tained, which may be preserved in- 
definitely. For employment, each part 
of the emulsion js diluted, according to 
circumstances, with from 10 to 20 parts 
of water. 

For Locusts.— Much trouble is ex- 
perienced in the Transvaal and Isatal 
with locust pests, the remedies used 
being either a soap spray, containing * 
pound ordinary household soap ift • 
gallons of water, or arsenite of soda, , tn 
latter being issued by the government to 
the purpose, and also used for the 
struction of prickly pear, and as a Dawj 
of tick dips. A solution of 1 pouno 
10 gallons of water is employed tor 
grown insects, and of 1 pound I *

End m ny mandibnlate insects kerosene 
S is much used. It is exhibited in the 
form of emulsion, which may be made as 
follows: 

Kerosene « g allons 

Common soap 8 ounces 

Water 1 S allon 

Dissolve the soap in the -water by the 
aid of heat, bring to .the boding po nt, 
and add the kerosene iB^n^agat. 
in* well after each addition. This is 
conveniently done by means of the pump 
to be used for spraying the mixture. 

For Scale Insects.— For destroying 
scale insects dilute the cochineal emul- 
sion (see above) with 9 times its volume 
of water; in the case of most others, ex- 
cept lice, dilute with 14 volumes, and ior 
the latter with 20 to 25 volumes. _ 

For the extermination of scale insects, 
resinous preparations are also em- 
ployed, which kill by covering them with 
an impervious coating. Such a wasn. 
may be made as follows: 

Rosin ?1 P° un ^ s 

Caustic soda 1 pound 

Fish oil 8 ou £ ces 

Water 20 gallons 

Boil the rosin, soda, and °j 1 ,. witl l, a 
small portion of the water, adding tne 
remainder as solution is effected. 

For the San Jose scale a stronger 
preparation is required, the Proportion 
of water being decreased by half, but 
such a solution is applied only when tne 
tree is dormant. 

Scale Insects on Orange Trees. --Scale 
insect enemies of orange trees are direct- 
ly controlled in two ways: (D By spray- 
ing the infested trees with some : liquid 
insecticide, and (2) by subjecting the™ to 
the fumes of hydrocyanic acid gas, com- 
monly designated as "gassing. A™ 



latter method is claimed to be the most 

effective means known of destroying scale 
insects. In practice the method con- 
sists in closing a tree, at night with a tent 
and filling the latter with the poisonous 
fumes generated by treating refined 
potassium cyanide (98 per cent) with 
commercial sulphuric acid (66 per cent) 
and water. The treatment should con- 
tinue from 30 to 40 minutes, the longe 
time being preferable. The work i 
done at night to avoid the scalding whic 
follows day applications, at least in brigh 
sunshine. 

The oily washes are said to be th 
best for the use by the spraying metho 
"Kerosene emulsion" is a type of thes 
washes. A formula published by the 
United States Department of Agricul- 
ture follows: Kerosene, 2 gallons; whale- 
oil soap, \ pound; water, 1 gallon. The 
soap is dissolved in hot water, the kero- 
sene added, and the whole thoroughly 
emulsified by means of a power pump 
until a rather heavy, creamy emulsion is 
produced. The quantity of soap may 
be increased if desired. The .insecti- 
cide is applied by spraying the infected 
tree with an ordinary force pump with 
spraying nozzle. 

Coating Against the Plant I*™e.- 
(a)— Mix 75 parts of green soap, 50 
parts of linseed oil, and 25 parts of car-

INSECT POWDERS 



To Keep Flaxseed Free from Bugs. — 
As a container use a tin can with a close- 
fitting top. At the bottom of the can 
place a small vial of chloroform with a 
foose-fitting cork stopper. Then pour 
the flaxseed, whole or ground, into the 
can, covering the vial. Enough of the 
chloroform will escape from the vial to 
kill such insects as infest the flaxseed. 

INSECT POWDERS. 

Pyrethrum, whale oil (in the form of 
^oap), fish oil (in the form of soap), soft 
soap, paraffine, Prussic acid, Paris green, 
white lead, sulphur, carbon bisulphide, 
acorus calamus, camphor, _ Cayenne 

Sepper, tobacco, snuff, asafetida, white 
ellebore, eucalyptol. quassia, borax, 
acetic ether are most important substances 
used as insecticides, alone, or in combi- 
nation of two or more of them. The 
Prussic acid and Paris green are dan- 
gerous poisons and require to be used 
with extreme care: 

Insect powder is used for all small in- 
sects and as a destroyer of roaches. The 
observations of some experimenters seem 
to show that the poisonous principle of 
these flowers is non-volatile, but the 
most favorable conditions under which 
to use them are in a room tightly closed 
and well warmed. There may be two 
poisonous principles, one of which is vola- 
tile. Disappointment sometimes arises 
in their use from getting powder either 
adulterated, or which has been exposed 
to the air and consequently lost some of 
its efficiency. 

. The dust resulting from the use of 
insect powder sometimes proves irri- 
tating to the mucous membranes of the 
one applying the powder. This is best 
avoided by the use of a spray atomizer 

Persistence in the use of any means is 
an important element in the work of 
octroying msects. A given poison may

which can be dissolved out from the drv 
flowers by means of ether. The leaves 
also contain this rosin but in smaller 
proportions than the flowers. Tincture 
of _ pyrethrum is made by infusing the 
dried flowers in five times their weight 
of rectified spirit of wine. Diluted with 
water it is used as a lotion. 

Borax powder also makes a very good 
insectiftige. It appears to be particu- 
larly effective against the common or 
kitchen cockroach. Camphor is sometimes 
used, and the powdered dried root of 
acorus calamus, the sweet flag. A mix- 
ture of white lead with four times its 
weight of chalk is also highly recom- 
mended. The fish-oil soaps used in a 
powdered form are made from various 
recipes, of which the following is a typi- 
cal example: 

Powdered rosin 2 pounds 

Caustic soda 8 ounces 

Fish or whale oil .... . 4 ounces 

Boil together in a gallon of water for 
at least an hour, replacing some of the 
water if required. 

The following insect-powder formulas 
are perfectly safe to use. In each in-

of the pyrethrum plants powdered, or to 
a mixture:

used to rub on the bites. 

Roach Exterminators. — Boras, starch, 
and cocoa are said to be the principal in- 
gredients of some of the roach foods on 
the market. A formula for a poison oi 
this class is as follows: 

Borax 37 ounces 

Starch 9 ounces

Moth Exterminators. — Cold storage is 
the most effective means of avoiding the 
ravages of moths. Where this is imprac- 
ticable, as in bureau drawers, camphor 
balls may be scattered about with satis- 
factory result. The following is also ef- 
fective : 

Spanish pepper 100 parts 

Turpentine oil 50 parts 

Camphor 25 parts 

Clove oil • • 10 parts 

Alcohol, 96 per cent. 900 parts 
Cut the Spanish pepper into little bits 
and pour over them the alcohol and oil of 
turpentine. Let stand 2 or 3 days, then 
decant, and press out. To the liquid 
thus obtained add the camphor and 
clove oil, let stand a few days, then filter 
and fill into suitable bottles. To use, 
imbibe bits of bibulous paper m the 
liquid and put them m the folds ot 
clothing to he protected. 

Protecting Stuffed Furniture from 
Moths.— The stuffing, no matter whether 
consisting of tow, hair, or fiber, as well 
as the covering, should be coated with a 
10 per cent solution of sulphur in carbon

Book-Worms. —When these insects 
infest books they are most difficult to 
deal with, as the ordinary destructive 
agents injuriously affect the paper of the 
book. The hooks should be well beaten 
and exposed to the sun, and a rag moist- 
ened with formalin passed through the 
binding and the covers where possible. 
In other cases the bottom edge of the 
binding should be moistened with forma- 
lin before putting on the shelves, so that 
formaldehyde vapor can be diffused.

IV An insulating material which 

contains no caoutchouc is made bv dis- 
solving natural or coal-tar asphalt in 
wood oil, adding sulphur and vulcanizing 
at 572° F The mixture of asphalt and 
wood oil may also be vulcanized with 
chloride of sulphur by the ordinary proc- 
ess used for caoutchouc. Before vul- 
canizing, a solution of rubber scraps in 
naphthalene is sometimes added and the 
naphthalene expelled by a current or 
steam. Substitutes for hard rubber are 
made of natural or artificial asphalt com- 
bined with heavy oil of tar and talc or 
infusorial earth. 

Most of the insulating materials ad- 
vertised under alluring names consist of 
asphalt combined with rosin, tar, and an 
inert powder such as clay or asbestos. 
Some contain graphite, which is a good 
conductor and therefore a very unde- 
sirable ingredient in an insulator. 

INSULATION AGAINST HEAT. 

An asbestos jacket is the usual insu- 
lator for boilers, steampipes, etc. The 
thicker the covering around the steam- 
pipe, the more heat is retained. A 
chief requirement for such protective 
mass is that it contains air in hue chan- 
nels, so that there is no connection with 
the closcd-in air. Most substances 
suitable for insulating are such that they 
can only with difficulty be used for a 
protective mass. The most ordinary 
way is to mix infusorial earth, kieselguhr, 
slag- wool, hair, ground cork, etc., with 
loam or clay, so that this plastic mass may 
be applied moist on the pipes. In using 
such substances care should be taken 
carefully to clean and heat the surfaces 
to be covered. The mass for the first 

C ^j ting 1S made int0 a P aste ky gradual 
addition of water and put on thick 
with a brush. After drying each time 
a further coating is applied. This 
ts repeated until the desired thickness 
is cached. The last layer put on is 
ruhbed smooth with the flat hand, 
finally, strips of linen are wound around, 
whic h is coated with tar or oil paint as a 
protection against outside injuries. Cork

Leather Waste Insulation. -Portions 



of leather, such as the fibers of 
leather of any size and form, are fi ♦ 
rendered soft. The surface i s t>. rst 
carded or the surface fibers scratched 
raised in such a manner that when & 
eral pieces are pressed together th ■ 
surface fibers adhere, and a comna *i 
durable piece of leather is produced 
The carding can be done by an ordinal 
batting machine, the action of which i 
so regulated that not only are the pieces 
of leather softened, but the fibers on 
their surfaces raised. The structure of 
the separate piecea of leather remains 
essentially unaltered. The raised fibers 
give the appearance of a furry substance 
to the leather. The batted pieces of 
leather are well mixed with paste or 
some suitable gum, either in or outside 
of the - machine, and are then put into 
specially shaped troughs, where they are 
pressed together into layers of the re- 
quired size and thickness. The separate 
pieces of leather adhere and are matted 
together. An agglutinant, if accessible, 
will contribute materially to the strength 
and durability of the product. The 
layers are dried, rolled, and are then 
ready for use. The pieces need not 
be packed together promiscuously. If 
larger portions of waste can be secured, 
the separate pieces can be arranged one 
upon another in rows. The larger pieces 
can also be used for the top and bottom 
of a leather pad, the middle portion of 
which consists of smaller pieces. 

INSULATION AGAINST MOISTURE, 

WEATHER, ETC. 

Experiments have shown that with the 
aid of red lead a very serviceable, resist- 
ive, and weatherproof insulation material 
may be produced from inferior fibers, to 
take the place, in many cases, of gutta- 
percha and other substances employee 
for insulating purposes, and particularly 
to effect the permanent insulation i « 
aerial conductors exposed to the a en 
of the weather. Hacketbal used for 
purpose any vegetable fiber whicn 
wrapped around the conductors to

with liquid red lead. The latter is 
complished in the proportion oi * 
parts of red lead, by weight, to 1 pa", j

process, by mere immersion or U 
pressure. All the three substance, 
fiber, oil, and red lead, possess m tn ^

Iron 

(See also Metals and Steel.) 
To Color Iron Blue.— One hundred 
and forty parts of hyposulphite of soda 
are dissolved in 1,000 parts of water; 35 
parts of acetate of lead are dissolved m 
1 000 parts of water; the two solutions 
are mixed, boiled, and the iron is im- 
mersed therein. The metal takes a blue 
color, such as is obtained by heating. 

To Distinguish Iron from Steel. —The 
piece of metal to be tested is washed and 
then plunged into a solution of bichro- 
mate of potash, with the addition or. 
considerable sulphuric acid. In half a 
minute or a minute the metal can be 
taken out, washed, and wiped. Solt 
steels and east iron assume under this 
treatment an ash-gray tint. Tempered 
steels become almost black, without any 
metallic reflection. Puddled and re- 
fined irons remain nearly white and al- 
ways have metallic reflections on the 
part of their surface previously filed, the 
remainder of the surface presenting ir- 
regular blackish spots. 

Another method is to apply a magnet. 
Steel responds much more quickly and 
actively to the magnetic influence than 
does iron. 

Powder for Hardening Iron and Steel. 

—For wrought iron place in the charge 
20 parts, by weight, of common salt; I 
parts, by weight, of potassium cyanide; 
0.3 parts, by weight, of potassium bi- 



chromate; 0.15 parts, by weight, of 
broken glass; and 0.1 part, by weight, of 
potassium nitrate for case-hardening. 
For cooling and hardening cast iron: To 
60 parts, by_ weight, of water add 2.5 
parts, by weight, of vinegar; 3 paTts, by 
weight, of common salt; and 0.25 parts, 
by weight, of hydrochloric acid. 

Preventing the Peeling of Coatings 
for Iron. — To obviate tb<=. scaling of coat- 
ings on iron, if exposed to the attacks of 
the weather, it is advisable to wash the 
iron thoroughly and to paint it next with 
a layer of boiling linseed oil. If thus 
treated, the paint never cracks off. If 
the iron objects are small and can be 
heated, it is advantageous to heat them 
previously and to dip them into linseed 
oil. The boiling oil enters all thepores 
of the metal and drives out the moisture. 
The coating adheres so firmly that frost, 
rain, nor wind can injure it. 

To Soften Iron Castings.— To soften 
hard iron castings, heat the object to a 
high temperature, cover it over with fine 
coal dust or some similar substance, and 
allow it to cool gradually. When the 
articles are of small size, a number of 
them are packed in a crucible with sub- 
stances yielding carbon to iron at a 
Blowing * heat The crucible is then 
tightly closed, and placed m a stove or on 
an open fire. It is gradually heated and 
kept at a red heat for several hours and 
then allowed to cool slowly. Cast-iron 
turnings, carbonate of soda, and unre- 
fined luga* are recommended as sub 
stances suitable for P*^l. m **<*g 
cible with the castings. If unreined 
sugar Ilone is added, the : quantity must 
not be too small. By this process the 
Ton inav be rendered extremely soft.

Etching on Ivory (see also Etching 
Although decorations on ivory articles" 
such as umbrella handles, cuff-buttons' 
fans, book -covers, boxes, etc., are sen' 
erally engraved, the work is frequently 
done by etching. The patterns must be 
very delicate, and are executed in lines 
only. The simplest way is to cover the 
surface with a thin rosin varnish. Then 
transfer the pattern and scratch it out ac- 
curately with a pointed needle. Otherwise 
proceed same as in etching on metal and 
stone, making an edge of modeling wax 
around the surface to be etched arid pour- 
ing on the acid, which consists, in this 
case, of sulphuric acid, 1 part, to which 
5 to 6 parts of water are added. It acts 
very quickly. The lines turn a deep 
black. If. brown lines are desired, dis- 
solve 1 part of silver nitrate in 5 parts of 
water, etch for a short time, and expose 
the article for a few hours to the light, 
until the design turns brown. Very 
often etchings in ivory are gilded. For 
this purpose, fill the etched patterns 
accurately with siccatives, using a writ- 
ing pen, dry, and dab on gold leat. 
After a few hours remove the superfluous 
gold with wadding, and the design.^ 
be nicelv gilded. Etched ivory articles 
present a very handsome appearance 
they are first covered with a silvery gi°g 
the design being gilded afterwards, f 
the former purpose the etched object *

IMITATION IVORY : 

See also Casein and Plaster. 

Manufacture of Compounds Imitating 
Ivory, Shell, etc.— Casein, as known, 
may act the part of an acid and combine 
with bases to form caseinates or caseates; 
among these compounds, caseinates of 
potash, of soda, and of ammonia are the 
only ones soluble in water; all the others 
are insoluble and may be readily pre- 
pared by double decomposition. Thus, 
for example, to obtain caseinate of 
alumina, it is sufficient to add to a solu- 
tion of casein in caustic soda a solution 
of sulphate of alumina; an insoluble 
precipitate of casein, or caseinate of 
alumina, is instantly formed. This pre- 
cipitate ought to be freed from the sul- 
phate of soda (formed by double de- 
composition) by means of prolonged 
washing. 

When pure, ordinary cellulose may be 
incorporated with it by this process, pro- 
ducing a new compound, cheaper than 
pure cellulose, although possessing the 
same properties, and capable of replacing 
it in all its applications. According to 
the results desired, in transparency, 
color, hardness, etc., the most suitable 
caseinate should be selected. Thus, if a 
translucent compound is to be obtained, 
the caseinate of alumina yields the best 
If a white compound is desired, the case- 
inate of zinc or of magnesia should be 
chosen; and for colored products the case- 
inates of iron, copper, and nickel will 
give varied tints. 

The process employed for the new 
products, with a base of celluloid and 
casemate, is as follows: On one hand 
casein is dissolved in a solution of caus- 
tic soda (100 of water for 10 to 25 of 
' this liquid is filtered, to sepa- 



rate the matters not dissolved and the 

impurities. 

On the other hand, a salt (of the base 
of which the caseinate is desired) is dis- 
solved, and the solution filtered. It is 
well not to operate on too concentrated a 
solution. The two solutions are mixed 
in a reservoir furnished with a mechan- 
ical stirrer, in order to obtain the insol- 
uble caseinate precipitate in a3 finely 
divided a state as possible. This precip- 
itate should be washed thoroughly so as 
to free it from the soda salt formed by 
double decomposition, but on account of 
its gummy or pasty state, this washing 
presents certain difficulties, and should 
be done carefully. After the washing it 
should be freed from the greater part of 
water contained by draining, followed 
by drying, or energetic pressing; then it 
is washed in alcohol, dried or pressed 
again, and is ready to be incorporated in 
the mass of the celluloid. 

For the latter immersion and washing, 
it has been found that an addition of 1 to 
5 per cent of borax is advantageous, for 
it renders the mass more plastic, and 
facilitates the operation of mixing. This 
may be conducted in a mixing apparatus; 
but, in practice, it is found preferable to 
effect it with a rolling mill, operated aa 
follows: . , , . 

The nitro-cellulose is introduced in 
the plastic state, and moistened with a 
solution of camphor in alcohol (40 to 5U 
parts of camphor in 50 to 70 parts of 
alcohol for 100 parts of n^ro-cellulose) 
as it is practiced in celluloid factories.

IVORY AND BONE BLEACHES. 

Tf simply dirty, scrub with soap and 
tepid water, using an old tooth or nail 
brush for the purpose. Grease stains 
may be sometimes removed by applying 
a paste of chalk or whiting and benzol, 
covering the article so that the benzol may 
lot dry too rapidly. Carbon disulphide 
(the purified article) may be used m place 
of benzol. When dry, rub off with a stiff 
brush. If not removed with the hrst 
application, repeat the process. Deli- 
cately carved articles that show a ten- 
dency to brittleness should be soaked for 
a short time in dilute phosphoric acid 
before any attempt to clean them is made. 
This renders the minuter portions almost 
ductile, and prevents their breaking un- 
der cleaning. 

The large scratched brush should be 
treated as follows: If the scratches are 
deep, the surface may be carefully rubbed 
down to the depth of the scratch, using 
the finest emery cloth, until the depth is 
nearly reached, then substituting crocus 
cloth. 

To restore the polish nothing is supe- 
rior to the genuine German putz pomade, 
following by rubbing first with chamois 
and finishing off with .soft old silk. The 
more "elbow grease" put into the rub- 
bing the easier the task, as the heat gen- 
erated by friction seems to lend a sort of 
ductility to the surface. To remove the 
yellow hue due to age, proceed as follows: 
Make a little tripod with wire, to hold 
the object a few inches above a little 
vessel containing lime chloride moistened 
with hydrochloric acid; put the object on 
the stand, cover the whole with a bell

IVORY TESTS. 

Many years ago an article ' 
duced in the industrial world 4h ,ltltr °" 
contradistinction to the genuin • lti 
ivory, has its origin in the vegetall**! 1 ? 11 * 1 
dom, being derived from the n „t ,8* 
palm-like shrub called phyteleni a 
crocarpa, whose fruit leaches tK^ - Snia - 
an apple. This fruit has a very ° f 
exceedingly hard kernel which „ , e = 
worked like ivory. A hundred of 5. 
fruits only costing about $1, thei 
offers great advantages. Worked USe 
the lathe this ivory can be passed off 011 
the gen uine article, it being so much lit 8 
it that it is often sold at the same nri 
It can also be colored just like eenuinl 
ivory. b ue 

To distinguish the two varieties of 
ivory, the following method may be 
employed: Concentrated sulphuric acid 
applied to vegetable ivory will cause a 
pink coloring in about 10 or 12 minutes 
which can be removed again by washing 
with water. Applied on genuine ivory, 
this acid does not affect it in any manner.

hole in a lathe with cement. Place a 
spirit lamp underneath to prevent the 
cement from hardening. Hold the 
pointed bit against the hole, while the 
lathe is running, until the hole is true, 
when the lamp should be removed. 1 lie 
broach to widen the hole should be made 
of copper, of the required size and shape, 
and the point, after being oiled, should 
be rolled in diamond dust until it is 
entirely covered. The diamond dust 
should then be beaten in with a burnish- 
er, using very light blows so as not to 
bruise the broach. After the hole is 
widened as desired, it requires polishing 
with a broach made of ivory and used 
with oil and the finest diamond dust, 
loose, net driven into the broach. 

To Clean Jet Jewelry.— Reduce bread 
crumbs into small particles, and intro-

Coloring Common. Gold,— In coloring 
gold below IS carat, the following mix- 
ture may be used with success, and if 
carefully employed, even 12 carat gold 
may be colored by it: Take nitrate of 
potassa (saltpeter), 4 parts, by weight; 
alum, % parts; and common salt, 2 parts. 
Add sufficient warm water to mix the 
ingredients into a thin paste; place the 
mixture in a small pipkin or crucible 
and allow to boil. The article to be 
colored should be suspended by a wire 
and dipped into the mixture, where it 
should remain from 10 to 20 minutes. 
The article should then be removed and 
well rinsed iri hot water, when it must be 
scratch brushed, again rinsed and re- 
turned to the coloring salts for a few 
minutes; it is then to be again rinsed in 
hot water, scratch brushed, and finally 
brushed with soap and hot water, rinsed 
in hot water, and placed in boxwood 
sawdust, The object being merely to 



remove the alloy, as soon as the article 
has acquired the proper color of fine gold 
it may be considered sufficiently acted 
upon by the above mixture. The color- 
ing salts should not be used for gold of a 
lower standard than 12 carat, and, even 
for this quality of gold, some care must 
be taken when the articles are of a very 
slight make. 

Shades of Red, etc., on Matt Gold 
Bijouterie.— For the production of the 
red and other shades on matt gold arti- 
cles, the so-called gold varnishes are 
employed, which consist of shellac dis- 
solved in alcohol and are colored with 
gum rosins. Thus a handsome golden 
yellow is obtained from shellac, 35 parts; 
seed-lac, 35 parts; dragon's blood, 50 
parts; gamboge, 50 parts; dissolved in 
400 parts of alcohol; the clear solution is 
decanted and mixed with 75 parts o* 
Venice turpentine. By changing the 
amounts of the coloring rosins, shades 
from bright gold yellow to copper color 
are obtained. The varnish is applie: 1 
evenly and after drying is wiped off froi 
the raised portions of the article b 
means of a pad of wadding dipped int. 
alcohol, whereby a handsome patina 
tlon effect is produced, since the lacque 
remains in the cavities. Chased articles 
are simply rubbed with earth color 
ground into a paste with turpentine oil- 
for which purpose burnt sienna, fin 
ochers of a golden color, golden yellow, 
and various shades of green are employed.

To Matt Gilt Articles.— If it is desired 
matt gilt articles partly or entirely, the 
portions which are to remain burnished 
are covered with a mixture of chalk, 
sugar, and mucilage, heating until this 
"stopping-off" covering shows a black 
color. On the places not covered apply 
a matting powder consisting of: 

Saltpeter 40 parts

whereby the powder is melted and ac-

To Find the Number of Carats. — To 
find the number of carats of gold in an 
object, first weigh the gold and mix with 
seven times its weight in silver. This 
alloy is beaten into thin leaves, and nitric 
acid is added; this dissolves the silver 
and copper. The remainder (gold) is 
then fused and weighed; by comparing 
the first and last weights the number of 
carats of pure gold is found. To check 
repeat several times. 

Acid Test for Gold.— The ordinary 
ready method of ascertaining whether a 
piece of jewelry is made of gold consists 
in touching it with a glass stopper wetted 
with nitric acid, which leaves gold un- 
touched, but colors base alloys blue from 
the formation of nitrate of copper.

To Refine Board Sweepings -^rn, 
residue resulting from a jobbing 
eler's business, such as board sweenin 
and other residuum, which is continualf 
accumulating and which invariably co / 
sists of all mixed qualities of standard 
may have the precious metals recovered 
therefrom in a very simple manner as 
foil ows: Collect the residue and burn it 
in an iron ladle or pan, until all grease 
or other organic matter is destroyed 
When cool mix with i part soda-ash, and 
melt in a clay crucible. When the metal 
is thoroughly melted it will leave the flux 
and sink to the bottom of the crucible* 
at this stage the flux assumes the appear- 
ance of a thin fluid, and then is the time 
to withdraw the pot from the fire. The 
metal in the crucible — but not the flux- 
may now be poured into a vessel of water, 
stirring the water in a circular direction 
while the metal is being poured in, which 
causes it to form into small grains, and 
so prepares it for the next process. Dis- 
solve the grains in a mixture of nitric 
acid and water in equal quantities. It 
takes about four times the quantity of 
liquid as metal to dissolve. The gold 
remains undissolved in this mixture, and 
may be recovered by filtering or decant 
ing the liquid above it in the dissolving 
vessel; it is then dried, mixed with a little 
flux, and melted in the usual manner, 
whereupon pure gold will be obtained. 
To recover the silver, dilute the solution 
which has been withdrawn from the goia 
with six times its bulk of water, and aaa 
by degrees small quantities of Mjg 
powdered common salt, and this 
throw down the silver into a white, cu j 
powder of chloride of silver. Continue 
add salt until no cloudiness is ° bser * 
in the solution, when the water 
the sediment may be poured J n, 
sediment is next well washed w«n d 
water several times, then drl *° g> 
melted in the same manner as 
and you will have a lump of pur e
