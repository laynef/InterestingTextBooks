CLEANING PREPARATIONS AND METHODS 



wood or ivory. The best method is to 
employ diamond powder. Take a little 
of the powder, make into a paste with 
fine oil, on the end of a copper Pusher 
tbesurface of which has been fresh y hied 
and slightly rounded. The marks will 
rapidly disappear when rubbed with this. 
The surface is left a little dull; it may be 
rendered bright by rubbing with the 
same powder mixed with a greater quan- 
tity of oil, and applied with a stick ot 
peg wood. Watchmakers will do well to 
try on disused dials several degrees ot 
fineness of the diamond powder. 

Cleaning Pearls.— Pearls turn yellow 
in the course of time by absorbing per- 
spiration on account of being worn in the 
hair, at the throat, and on the arms. 
There are several ways of rendering 
them white again. _ 

I. — The best process is said to be to 
put the pearls into a bag with wheat bran 
and to heat the bag over a coal fire, with 
constant motion. 

II. — Another method is to bring 8 
parts each of well-calcined, finely pow- 
dered lime and wood charcoal, which 
has been strained through a gauze sieve, 
to a boil with 500 parts of pure rain 
water, suspend the pearls over the steam 
of the boiling water until they are 
warmed through, and then boil them in 
the liquid for 5 minutes, turning fre- 
quently. Let them cool in the liquid, 
take them out, and wash off well with 
clean water. 

III. — Place the pearls in a piece of fine 
linen, throw salt on them, and tie them 
up. Next rinse the tied-up pearls in 
lukewarm water until all the salt has 
been extracted, and dry them at an ordi- 
nary temperature. 

IV. — The pearls may also be boiled 
about \ hour in cow's milk into which a 
little cheese or soap has been scraped; 
take them out, rinse off in fresh water, 
and dry them with a clean, white cloth. 

V. — Another method is to have the 
pearls, strung on a silk thread or wrapped 
U P in thin gauze, mixed in a loaf of bread 
of barley flour and to have the loaf baked 
well in an oven, but not too brown. 
When cool remove the pearls. 

yi- — Hang the pearls for a couple of 
minutes in hot, strong, wine vinegar or 
highly diluted sulphuric acid, remove, 
and rinse them in water. Do not leave 
"to. too long in the

GLASS CLEANING: 



tw,S i a £ mg Reparation for Glass with 
Metal Decorations.— Mix 1,000 parts of 
denatured st)irit «6 per cent) with 150 



parts, by weight, of ammonia- go t,- 
of acetic ether; 15 parts of ethvlic Jit 
200 parts of Vienna lime; 950 parts j 
bolus; and 550 parts of oleinef 
this mixture both glass and metal can V. 
quickly and thoroughly cleaned. It ' 
particularly recommended for s h U 
windows ornamented with metal. ° W 
Paste for Cleaning Glass.— 

Prepared chalk 6 poUlld 

Powdered French 

P , chal K- H pounds 

Phosphate calcium. . . pounds 
Quillaia bark. .. .. p ounds 
Carbonate ammonia.. 18 ounces 

Rose pink 6 ounces 

Mix the ingredients, in fine powder 
and sift through muslin. Then mix 
with soft water to the consistency of 
cream, and apply to the glass by means 
of a soft rag or sponge; allow it to dry on 
wipe off with a cloth, and polish with 
chamois. 

Cleaning Optical Lenses. — For this 
purpose a German contemporary rec- 
ommends vegetable pith. The medulla 
of rushes, elders, or sunflowers is cut out, 
the pieces are dried and pasted singly 
alongside of one another upon a piece of 
cork, whereby a brush-like apparatus h 
obtained, which is passed over the sur- 
face of the lens. For very small lenses 
pointed pieces of elder pith arc em- 
ployed. To dip dirty and greasy lenses, 
into oil of turpentine or ether and rub 
them with a linen rag, as has been pro- 
posed, seems hazardous, because the Can- 
ada balsam with which the lenses are 
cemented might dissolve. 

To Remove Glue from Glass.— If glue 
has simply dried upon the glass hot 
water ought to remove it. If, however, 
the spots are due to size (the ^latmous 
wash used by painters) when dried tney 
become very refractory and recoup 
must be had to chemical means f° r . tneir 
removal. The commonest size being 
solution of gelatin, alum, and r05in ^ 
solved in a solution of soda and c° 
bined with starch, hot solutions ot cau 
tic soda or of potash may be u3C £; tei 
that fails to remove them, try « ^ 
hydrochloric, sulphuric, or any fl 
stronger acids. If the spots st, 1 re 
some abrasive powder (Hour w . j 
must be used and the glass * e P° aJjS 0 f

Kmirities which have remained on 
jt'Zs at the factory, and even with 
inferior panes a good appearance is ob- 
tained. 

To Clean Store "Windows.— For clean- 
ino the large panes of glass of store wm- 
£a and also ordinary show cases, a 
semiliquid paste may be employed 
made of calcined magnesia and punned 
benzine. The glass should be rubbed 
with a cotton rag until it is brilliant. 

Cleaning Lamp Globes. — Pour 2 spoon- 
fuls of a slightly heated solution of potash 
into the globe, moisten the whole surface 
with it, and rub the stains with a .fine 
linen rag; rinse the globe with clean 
water and carefully dry it with a fine, soft 
doth. 

To Clean Mirrors. — Rub the mirror 
with a hall of soft paper slightly damp- 
ened with methylated spirits, then with a 
duster on which a little whiting has been 
sprinkled, and finally polish with clean 
paper or a wash leather. This treatment 
will make, the glass beautifully bright. 

To Clean Milk Glass. — To remove oil 
spots from milk glass panes and lamp 
globes, knead burnt magnesia with ben- 
zine to a plastic mass, which must be 
kept in a tight-closing bottle. A little of 
™s substance rubbed on the spot with a 
linen rag will make it disappear.

To Clean Playing Cards.— Slightly 
soiled playing cards may be made clear 
by rubbing them with a soft rag dipped 
in a solution of camphor. Very little of 
the latter is necessary. 

To Remove Vegetable Growth from 
Buildings. — To remove moss and lichen 
from stone and masonry, apply water 
in which 1 per cent of carbolic acid has 
been dissolved. After a few hours the 
plants can be washed off with water. 

Solid Cleansing Compound.— The basis 
of most of the solid grease eradicators 
is benzine and the simplest form is a 
benzine jelly made by shaking 3 ounces 
of tincture of quillaia (soap bark) with 
enough benzine to make 16 ^donnce^ 
Benzine may also be solidified by the use 
of a soap with addition of an excess

CLEANING PREPARATIONS— COFFEE 



II — Castife soap, white. 3 J av. ounces 

Water, boiling 81 fluidounces 

Water of ammonia 5 fluidrachms 
Benzine enough to 

make 16 fluidounces 

Dissolve the soap in the water, and 
when cold, add the other ingredients. 

To Clean Oily Bottles.— Use 2 heaped 
tabiespoonfuls (for every quart of capac- 
ity) of fine sawdust or wheat bran, and 
shake well to cover the interior surface 
thoroughly; let stand a few minutes and 
then add about a gill of cold water. It 
the bottle be then rotated m a horizontal 
position, it will usually be found clean 
after a single treatment. In the case or 
drying oils, especially when old, the bot- 
tles should be moistened inside with a 
little ether, and left standing a few hours 
before the introduction of sawdust 
This method is claimed to be more rapid 
and convenient than the customary one 
of using strips of paper, soap solution, 
etc. 

Cork Cleaner. — Wash in 10 per cent 
solution of hydrochloric acid, then im- 
merse in a solution of sodium hypo- 
sulphite and hydrochloric acid. Finally 
the corks are washed with a solution of 
soda and pure water. Corks containing 
oil or fat cannot be cleaned by this 
method. 

To Clean Sponges. — Rinse well first in 
very weak, warm, caustic-soda lye, then 
with clean water, and finally leave the 
sponges in a solution of bromine in water 
until clean. They will whiten sooner if 
exposed to the sun in the bromine water. 
Then repeat the rinsings in weak lye 
and clean water, using the latter till all 
smell of bromine has disappeared. Dry 
quickly and in the sun if possible. 



To Clean Leather Chairs. — Thor- 
oughly beat the whites of three eggs, 
then with a piece of soft flannel cloth 
rub the beaten whites into the leather 
of the chair seat. The leather will soon 
be clean and will shine as if new. Lamp 
black may be added if the leather is 
black. 

To Clean or Flush Toilets. — Mix 
together 1 pound common washing soda 
in powdered form with 3 ounces of 
caustic soda. This can be sprinkled in 
the bowl of the toilet, letting it remain 
in it for several hours. A little water to 
moisten the same should be used. 



To Clean Waste Pipes.— Simple i n 
expensive method method of dearnW fT 
pipe is as follows: Just before retirin 
at night pour into the pipe enough Um& 
potash (not soda) lye of 36° strength t 
nil the "trap," as it is called, or W 
portion of the pipe just below the outlet 
About a pint will suffice for a wash 
stand, or a quart for a bath-tub or 
kitchen sink. Be sure that no water runs 
into it till next morning. During the 
night the lye will change all of the offal 
in the pipe into soft soap, and the first 
current of water in the morning will 
remove it entirely, and leave the pipe as 
clean as new. Two applications of the 
lye should be enough to cure any case. 
The so-called potash lye sold in small tin 
cans in the shops is not recommended for 
this purpose; it is quite commonly mis- 
named, and is called caustic soda, which 
makes a hard soap. That may block up 
the pipe even worse than the material 
it was desired to remove. 

To Clean Windshields. — Use equal 
parts of denatured alcohol and ether. 
Apply this mixture to the glass with a 
clean woolen cloth. Rub briskly, then 
sprinkle a little of jeweler's rouge upon 
a piece of chamoise skin and polish. The 
result will be that the glass will shine 
like crystal.

MUSTARD : 

The Prepared Mustards of Commerce. 
— The mustard, i. e., the flower or pow- 
dered seed, used in preparing the different 
condiments, is derived from three varie- 
ties of Brassica (Cruciferce) — Brassica 
alba L., Brassica nigra, and Brassica 
iuncea. The first yields the "white" 
of commerce, which produces a mild 
lustard; the second the "black" seed, 
ielding the more pungent powder; and 
e latter a very pungent and oily mus- 
rd, much employed by Russians. The 
mngency of the condiment is also af- 
fected by the_ method of preparing the 
paste, excessive heat destroying the 
sharpness completely. The pungency 
" further controlled and tempered, in 
ie cold processes, by the addition of 
rhe&t or rye flour, which also has the 
ivantage of serving as a binder of the 

U u J he mustard flour is pre- 
by first decorticating the seed, 
en grinding to a fine powder, the ex- 
S° n «f the fixed oil from which 
ompletes the process, 
he volatile, is of 
and o" 
make 



This oil, unlike

commerce. ■ 

Mustard Cakes.— In the mixture, the 
amount of flour used depends on the 
pungency of the mustard flower, and the 
flavor desired to be imparted to the fin- 
ished product. The cakes are broadly 
divided into the yellow and the brown. 
A general formula for the yellow cake is: 

Yellow mustard, from 20 to 30 per 
cent; salt, from 1 to 3 per cent; spices, 
from J to i of 1 per cent; wheat flour, 
from 8 to 12 per cent. 

Vinegar, must, or wine, complete the 
mixture. 

The brown cake is made with blaci 
mustard, and contains about the follow- 
ing proportions: 

Black mustard, from 20 to 30 pe 
cent; salt, from 1 to 3 per cent; spices, 
from £ to J of 1 per cent; wheat or rye 
flour, from 10 to 15 per cent. 

The variations are so wide, however 
that it is impossible to giv e _ exa | t t Jgjj

cream Bonbons for Hoarseness.— 
Stir into 500 parts of cream oOO parts oi. 
white sugar. Put in a pan and cook, 
with continuous stirring, until it becomes 
brown and viscid. Now put in a bak- 
ing tin and smooth out, as neatly as pos- 
sible, to the thickness of, say, twice that 
of the back of a table knife and let it 
harden. Before it gets completely hard 
draw lines with a knife across the sur- 
face in such manner that when it is quite 
hard it will break along them, easily, into 
bits the size of a lozenge. 

Nut Candy Sticks.— Cook to 320° F. 
8 pounds best sugar in 3 pints water, 
with 4 pounds glucose added. Pour out 
on an oiled slab and add 5 pounds al- 
monds, previously blanched, cut in small 
ieces, and dried in the drying room, 
ix up well together to incorporate the 
uts thoroughly with the sugar. When 
t has cooled enough to be handled, form 
"nto a round mass on the slab and spin 
out m long, thin sticks. 

Fig Squares. — Place 5 pounds of 
ugar and 5 pounds of glucose in a cop- 
per pan, with water enough to dissolve 
the sugar. Set on the fire, and when it 
tarts to boil add 5 pounds of ground 
figs. Stir and cook to £40° on the ther- 
mometer. Set off the fire, aud then add 
& pounds of fine cocoanuts; mix well and 
pour out on greased marble, roll smooth, 
and cut like caramels. 

Caramels. — Heat 10 pounds sugar and 
S pounds glucose in a copper kettle until 
dissolved. A.dd cream to the mixture 
** intervals, until 2£ quarts are used. 
Add 2£ pounds caramel butter and 12 
ounces paradine wax to the mixture. 
Cook to a rather stiff ball, add nuts, pour 
out between iron bars and, when cool 
enough, cut into strips. For the white 
ones flavor with vanilla, and add 2 
pounds melted chocolate liquor for the 
cnocolate caramel when nearly cooked. 
Candy Orange Drops.— It is compar- 



atively easy to make a hard c^A , 
to put the material into "diw- * ut 
apparently requires ex per i en p f °rm 
machine. To make the candv * a 
put, say, a pint of water into n «, ?r^. 
pan or kettle, heat to boiling an i ab > 
gradually to it 2 pounds or more of ^ 
stirring well so as to avoid the T - U | ar > 
burning the sugar. Continue hlfv* 
the syrup so formed until a little 2" * 
poured on a cold slab forms a mass of \\ 
required hardness. If the candy is L J e 
of orange flavor, a little fresh oil of 
ange is added just before the mass °£ 
ready to set and the taste is im pm Ji 
according to the general view at least 
by adding, also, say, 2 drachms of citric 
acid dissolved in a very little water. ^ E 
a coloring an infusion of saf&ower or 
tincture of turmeric is used. 

To make such a mass into tablets, it is 
necessary only to pour out on a well- 
greased slab, turning the edges back iE 
inclined to run, until the candy is firm, 
and then scoring with a knife so that 
it can easily be broken into pieces whea 
cold. To make "drops" a suitable 
mold is necessary. 

Experiment as to the sufficiency of the 
boiling in making candy may be saved 
and greater certainty of a good result se- 
cured by the use of a chemical thermom- 
eter. As the syrup is boiled and the 
water evaporates the temperature of the 
liquid rises. When it reaches 220° F 
the sugar is then in a condition to vie d 
the "thread" form; at 240° "soft ball 
is formed; at 245°, "hard ball"; at 2o2 , 
"crack 55 ; and at 290°, "hard crack. 
By simply suspending the thermometer 
in the liquid and observing it from time 
to time, one may know exactly when to 
end the boiling.

A Good Summer Taffy. — Place in a 
kettle 4 pounds of sugar, 3 pounds of

and'color if you wish. Pull until light, 
then spin out on the table in strips about 3

It 



necessary to watch the coppeVearefulW 
so that when it has reached thl rfSfi 
temperature it may be drawn from the 
muffle and allowed to cool. This i! 
important, for if the copper is heated too 
high, or is left in the muffle at the ordi- 
nary temperature of annealing too long 
it is burnt, as the workmen say. Copper 
that has been burnt is yellow, coarsely 
granular, and exceedingly brittle — even 
more brittle at a red heat than when 
cold. 

In the case of coarse wire it is found 
that only the surface is burnt, while the 
interior is damaged less. This causes 
the exterior to split loose from the in- 
terior when bent or rolled, thus giving 
the appearance of a brittle copper tube 
with a copper wire snugly fitted into it. 
Cracks a half inch in depth have been 
observed on the surface of an ingot on its 
first pass through the rolls, all due to 
this exterior burning. It is apparent 
that copper that has been, thus over- 
heated in the muffle is entirely unfit for 
rolling. It is found that the purer forms 
of copper are less liable to be harmed by 
overheating than samples containing 
even a small amount of impurities. 
Even the ordinary heating in a muffle 
will often suffice to burn in this manner 
the surface of some specimens of copper, 
rendering them unfit for further working. 
Copper that has been thus ruined is ot 
use only to be refined again. d 

As may be inferred only the highest 
grades of refined copper are used tor 
drawing or for rolling. This is not be-

COPPER 



«vide of copper is freely soluble in 
Stallic copS and thus penetrates o 
parts of tie copper, and parting with 
its oxygen, oxidizes the .impurities. 



all parts of the cop] 

||e^S</£e educing part of the 



of the 'suboxide of copper to 
copper. Copper containing even less 
thfn 1 per cent of the suboxide of copper 
shows decreased malleability and duc- 
tility, and is both cold-short and red- 
short. If the copper to be refined con- 
tains any impurities, such as arsenic or 
antimony, it is well not to remove too 
much of the oxygen in the refining proc- 
ess If this is done, overpoled copper 
is produced. In this condition it is 
brittle, granular, of a shining yellow 
color, and more red-short than cold- 
short. When the refining has been prop- 
erly done, and neither too much nor too 
little oxygen is present, the copper is in 
the condition of " tough pitch," and is in 
a fit state to be worked. 

Copper is said to be "tough pitch 
when it requires frequent bending to break 
it, and when, after it is broken, the color 
is pale red, the fracture has a silky lus- 
ter, and is fibrous like a tuft of silk. On 
hammering a piece to a thin plate it 
should show no cracks at the edge. At 
tough pitch copper offers the liighest 
degree of malleability and ductility of 
which a given specimen is capable. 
This is the condition in which refined 
copper is (or should be) placed on the 
market, and if it could be worked with- 
out changing this tough pitch, any 
specimen of copper that could be brought 
to this condition would be suitable for 
rolling or drawing, But tough pitch is 
changed if oxygen is either added or 
taken from refined copper. 

By far the more important of these is 
the removal of oxygen, especially from 
those specimens that contain more than a 
mere trace of impurities. This is shown 
by the absolutely worthless condition 
of overpoled copper. The addition of 
carbon also plays a very important part 
in the production of overpoled copper. 

That the addition of oxygen to refined 
copper is not so damaging is shown by 
the fact that at present nearly all the cop- 
per that is worked is considerably oxi- 
dized at some stage of the process, and 
not especially to its detriment. 

Burnt copper is nothing more or less 
man copper m the overpoled condition. 
A his is brought about by the action of 
reducing gases in the muffle. Bv this 
means the small amount of oxygen nec- 

amoved. This oxygen is combined 



with impurities in the cop per 
renders them inert. For exam 
oxide of arsenic or antimony ? • tlle 
pable of combining morR than ii 1 * 
ically with the copper, but when T 
gen is removed the arsenic or B „? 03! J' 
is left free to combine with thJ on * 
This forms a brittle alloy, and orT^ 
corresponds almost exactly i n it s hat 
ties with overpoled copper. To b °^ eT * 
overpoled copper is supposed to conE? 
carbon, but that this is not the esse M 
ruling principle in case oF anneal W 8 
shown by the tact thai pure copper do„ 
not undergo > this change under CO ndi 
tions that rum impure copper, and also 
by the fact that the same state may W 
produced by annealing in pure hydro- 
gen and thus removing the oxygen tha" 
renders the arsenic or antimony inert 
No attempt is made to deny the well 
known fact that carbon does combin 
with copper to the extent of 0.2 per cen 
and cause it to become exceedingl 
brittle. It is simply claimed that this ' 
probably not what occurs in the pr 
duction of so-called burnt copper durin 
annealing. The amount oE impuriti 
capable of rendering copper easily burn 
is exceedingly small. This may be bet 
ter appreciated when it is considere 
that from 0.01 to 0.2 per cent express 
the amount of oxygen necessary to ren 
dcr the impurities inert. The remov 
of this very small amount of oxyge - 
which is often so small as to be aim; 
within the limits of the errors of analysis 
will suffice to render copper overpol 
and ruin it for any use. , 

There are methods of avoiding tfl 
numerous accidents that may occur 
the annealing of copper, due to a chan 
of pitch. As already pointed out, w 
quality of refined copper is ^eiea 
oxygen be either added to oi - taken f o 
it. It is quite apparent, therefore, 
a really good method of anneal « 
per will prevent any change in ine 
of oxidation. It is necessary to ' F ^ 
access to the heated copper uot ~ 
mospheric air, which would ° x heat 
and of the reducing gases use a

Zurs may be used in the process, as in 
thVannealing of iron wire, with no detn- 
mnA to the wire. This may seem in- 
edible to those manufacturers who 
Uye tried to anneal copper wire after 
the manner of annealing iron wire. By 
this method perfectly bright annealed 
wire may be produced. Such a process 
of annealing copper offers many advan- 
tages. It allows the use of a grade of 
copper that has hitherto been worked 
only at a great disadvantage, owing to its 
tendency to get out-of pitch. It allows 
the use of annealers such as are ordi- 
narily employed for annealing iron, and 
thus cheapens the annealing consider- 
ably as compared with the present use of 
muffles. There is no chance of produc- 
ing the overpoled condition from the 
action of reducing gases used in heating 
the muffles. There is no chance of pro- 
ducing the underpoled condition due to 
the absorption of suboxide of copper. 
None of the metal is lost as scale, and the 
saving that is thus effected amounts to a 
considerable percentage of the total 
value of the copper. The expense and 
time of cleaning are wholly saved. In- 
cidentally bright annealed copper is 
produced by a process which is appli- 
cable to copper of any shape, size, or

COPYING PRINTED PICTURES. 

The so-called "metallic" paper used 
for steam-engine indicator cards has a 
smooth surface, chemically prepared so 
that black lines can be drawn upon it 
with pencils made of brass copper, sil- 
ver, aluminum, or any of the softer 
metals. When used on the indicator it 
receives the faint line drawn by a brass 
point at one end of the pencil arm, and 
its special advantage over ordinary paper 
is that the metallic pencil slides over its 
surface with very little friction, and keeps 
its point much longer than a graphite 
pencil. 

This paper can be used as a transfer 
paper for copying engravings or sketches, 
or anything printed or written in ink or 
drawn in pencil. 

The best copies can be obtained by 
following the directions below: Lay 
the metallic transfer paper, face up, upon 
at least a dozen sheets of blank paper, 
and lay the print face down upon it. On 
the back of the print place a sheet of 
heavy paper, or thin cardboard, and run 
the rubbing _ tool over this protecting 
sheet. In this manner it is comparative- 
ly easy to prevent slipping, and prints 8 
or 10 inches on a side may be copied 
satisfactorily. 

Line drawings printed from relief 
plates, or pictures with sharp contrast 
of black and white, without any half- 
tones, give the best copies. Very few 
half-tones can be transferred satisfac- 
torily; almost all give streaked, indis- 
tinct copies, and many of the results are 
worthless. 

The transfer taken of? as described is 
a reverse of the original print. If the 
question of right and left is not impor- 
tant this reversal will seldom be obiec-

than the first, but almost always 
be made dark enough to show a d

For indicator cards the paper is pje _ 
pared by coating one surface with a suit" 
able compound, usually zinc oxide muS 
with a little starch and enough g! ue Z 
make it adhere. After drying it j° 
passed between calendar rolls under great 
pressure. The various brands manu- 
i tactured for the trade, though perhaps 
equally good for indicator diagrams, are 
not equally well suited for copying.' h 
paper of firmer texture could he prepared 
with the same surface finish, probably 
much larger copies could be produced. 

Other kinds of paper, notably the 
heavy plate papers used for some oftbe 
best trade catalogues, possess this trans- 
fer property to a slight degree, though 
they will not receive marks from a me- 
tallic pencil. The latter feature would 
seem to recommend them for transfer 
purposes, making them less likely to be- 
come soiled by contact with metallic 
objects, but so far no kind has been 
found which will remove enough ink 
to give copies anywhere near as dark 
the indicator paper. L 
Fairly good transfers can be raw

in a strong solution of alum, and then 
carefully drying them. 

Preservation of Fishing Nets. — The 
following recipe for the preservation of 
fishing nets is also applicable to ropes, 
etc., in contact with water. Some have 
been subjected to long test. 

For 40 parts of cord, hemp, or cot- 
ton, 8 parts of kutch, 1 part of blue 
vitriol, \ part of potassium chromate, 
and 2A parts of wood tar are required. 
The kutch is boiled with 150 parts of 
water until dissolved, and then the blue 
vitriol is added. Next, the net is entered 
ana the tar added. The whole should 
be stirred well, and the cordage must boil 
5 to 8 minutes. Now take out the net- 
ting, lay it in another vessel, cover up 
wed and leave alone for 12 hours. After 
that it is dried well, spread out in a clean

CORKS— CORN CURES 



Non-Porous Corks.— For benzine, tur- 
entine, and varnish cans, immerse the 
oTks in hot melted paraffine Keep 
em under about 5 minutes; hold them 
own with a piece of wire screen cut to 
t the dish in which you melt the parai- 
ne. When taken out lay them, on a 
creen till cool. Cheap corks can in this 
ay be made gas- and air-tight, and can 
e cut and bored with ease. 
Substitute for Cork.— Wood pulp or 
ther ligneous material may be treated 
o imitate cork. For the success of the 
omposition it is necessary that the con- 
stituents be mingled and treated under 
special conditions. The volumetric pro- 
portions in which these constituents 
combine with the best results are the fol- 
lowing: Wood pulp, 3 parts; cornstalk 
pith, 1 part; gelatin, 1 part; glycerine, 
1 part; water, 4 parts; 20 per cent formic- 
aldehyde solution, 1 part; but the pro- 
portions may be varied. After disinte- 
grating the ligneous substances, and 
while these are in a moist and hot condi- 
tion they are mingled with the solution 
of gelatin, glycerine, and water. The 
mass is stirred thoroughly so as to obtain 
a homogeneous mixture. The excess of 
moisture is removed. As a last opera- 
tion the formic aldehyde is introduced, 
and the mass is left to coagulate in this 
solution. The formic aldehyde renders 
the product insoluble in nearly all liquids. 
So it is in this last operation that it is 
necessary to be careful in producing the 
composition properly. When the oper- 
ation is terminated the substance is sub- 
mitted to pressure during its coagulation, 
either by molding it at once into a desired 
form, or into a mass which is afterwards 
converted into the finished product.

1 les should be of well-seasoned leather, 
loft and elastic, and should be cut to a 
nroner model. 

II —The palliative treatment is gen- 
erally carried out with chemical sub- 
stances The best method, is, briefly, 
as follows: A ring of glycerine jelly is 
painted around the circumference of the 
corn, to form a raised rampart. A piece 
of salicylic plaster mull is then cut tothe 
size and shape of the central depression, 
and applied to the surface of the corn. 
This is then covered with a layer of glyc- 
erine jelly, and before it sets a pad of 
cotton wool is applied io the surface. 
This process is repeated as often as is 
necessary, until the horny layer separates 
and is cast off. 

If the point of a sharp, thin-bladed 
knife be introduced at the groove which 
runs around the margin of the corn, and 
be made to penetrate toward its central 
axis, by the exercise of a little manual 
dexterity the horny part of the corn can 
be easily made to separate from the parts 
oeneatL

Rouge Tablets.— There are two di s 
tinct classes of these tablets: those S 
which the_ coloring matter is carniin 
and those in which the aniline colors are 
used. The best are those prepared with 
carmine, or ammonium carminate to 
speak more correctly. The following is 
an excellent formula: 

Ammonium carminate. . . 10 parts 

Talc, in powder 25 p ar ( s 

Dextrin 8 parts 

Simple syrup, sufficient. 
Perfume, to taste, sufficient. 

Mix the tale and dextrin and add the 
perfume, preferably in the .shape of an 
essential oil (attar of rose, synthetic oil of 
jasmine, or violet, etc.), using 6 to 8 
drops to every 4 ounces of other in- 
gredients. Incorporate the ammonium 
carminate and add just enough simple 
svrup to make a mass easily rolled out. 
Out into tablets of the desired size. The 
ammonium carminate is made by adding 
1 part of carmine to 2i parts of strung 
ammonia water. Mix in a vial, cork 
tightly, and set aside until a solutionis 
formed, shaking occasionally. The am- 
monium carminate is made by dissolving 
carmine in ammonia water to saturation.

Hand-Cleaning Paste.— Cleaning pastes 
are composed of soap and grit, either 
with or without some free alkali. Any 
soap may be used, but a white soap is 
preferred. Castile soap does not make 
as firm a paste as soap made from animal 
fats, and the latter also lather better. 
For grit, anything may be used, from 
powdered pumice to fine sand. 

A good paste may be made by dissolv- 
ing soap in the least possible quantity of 
hot water, and as it cools and sets stirring 
in the grit. A good formula is: 

White soap 9\ pounds 

Fine sand 1 P ound 

Water H pints
