handling, although thc cheaper grades 
are not to be handled carelessly. The 
Havana cigars are more susceptible to 
change, for there is a delicacy of flavor to 
be preserved that is never present in thc 
cheaper grades of cigars. 

Every dealer must, of course, make a 
display in his show case, buL he need not 
serve his patrons with these cigars. The 
shrinkage in value of the cigars in the 
case is merely a business proposition of 
profit and loss.

Cigar Spots.— The speckled appear- 
ance of certain wrappers is due to the 
work of a species of fungus that attacks 
the growing tobacco. In a certain dis- 
trictof Sumalra, which produces an ex- 
ceptionally fine tobacco for wrappers, 
the leaves of the plant are commonly 
speckled in this way. Several patents 
have been obtained for methods of spot- 
ting tobacco leaves artificially. A St. 
Louis firm uses a solution composed of: 

Sodium carbonate 3 parts 

Calx chlorinata 1 part 

Hot water 8 parts 

Dissolve the washing soda in the hot 
water, add the chlorinated lime, and 
heat the mixture to a boiling tempera- 
ture for 3 minutes. When cool, decant 
into earthenware or stoneware jugs, cork 
tightly, and keep in a cool place, lne 
corks of jugs not intended for immediate 
use should be covered with a piece ot 
bladder or strong parchment paper, ana 
tightly tied down to prevent the escape ot 
gf s , and consequent weakemng of the 
bleaching power of the fluid. The pre-

CLARIFYING— CLEANING PREPARATIONS 



ARIFICATION OF GELATIN" AND 

GLUE: 
See Gelatin. 

LARIFY1NG. 

Clarification is the process by which 
any solid particles suspended in a liquid 
1™ either caused to coalesce together or 
?o adhere to the medium used fordar- 
ifving that they may be removed bv fil- 
& (which 7 would P«™^J^ 
been impossible), so as to render tnc 

^Oae'ofThe best agents for this purpose 
is albumen. When clarifying vegetable 
extracts, the albumen which w naturally 
present in most plants accomplishes this 
purpose easily, provided the vegetable 
matter is extracted in the cold so as to 
get as much albumen as possible in solu- 

tl(> Egg albumen may also be used. The 
effect of albumen may be increased by 
the addition of cellulose, in the form ot a 
fine magma of filtering paper. This has 
the further advantage that the subse- 
quent filtration is much facilitated. 

Suspended particles of gum or pectin 
may be removed by cautious precipita- 
tion with tannin, of which only an ex- 
ceedingly small amount is usually neces- 
sary. It combines with the gelatinous 
substances better with the aid of heat 
than in the cold. There must be no ex- 
cess of tannin used. 

Another method of clarifying liquids 
turbid from particles of gum, albumen, 
pectin, etc., is to add to them a definite 
quantity of alcohol. This causes the 
former substances to separate in more or 
less large flakes. The quantity of alco- 
hol required varies greatly according to 
the nature of the liquid. It should be 
determined in each case by an experiment 
on a small scale. 

Resinous or waxy substances, such as 
are occasionally met with in honey, etc., 
may be removed by the addition of bole, 
pulped filtering paper, and heating to 
boiling. 

In each case the clarifying process 
may be hastened by making the separat- 
ing particles specifically heavier; that is, 
by incorporating some heavier sub- 
stance, such as talcum, etc., which may 
cause the flocculi to sink more rapidly, 
and to form a compact sediment. 

Clarifying powder for alcoholic liquids: 

Egg albumen, dry 40 parts 

Sugar of milk 40 parts 

Starch go parts 

Reduce them to very fine powder, and 
mix thoroughly. 



For clarifying liquors, brines, e SSpn 
etc., take for every quar t of ^ 
grains of the above mixture shaW 75 
peatedly in the course of a f e ' w d *J ^ 
mixture being kept in a warm YooT 
then filter. 1 «om, 

Powdered talcum renders the 
service, and has the additional adv^ 
tage of being entirely insoluble ul a ~ 
ever, the above mixture acts more en?/ 
gctically. 

CLAY: 

Claying Mixture for For ges ._ Tweilt 
parts fire clay; 20 parts cast-iron turn 
mgs; 1 part common salt; \ part sal am- 
moniac; all by measure. 

The materials should be thoroughly 
mixed dry and then wet down to the con- 
sistency of common mortar, constantly 
stirring the mass as the wetting proceeds 
A rough mold shaped to fit the tuyere 
opemDg, a trowel, and a few minutes 
time are all that are needed to complet 
the successful claying of the forge. T" 
mixture dries hard and when glazed b 
the fire will last. 

Plastic Modeling Clay. — A perm 
nently plastic clay can be obtained by 
first mixing it with glycerine, turpen- 
tine, or similar bodies, and then adding 
vaseline or petroleum residues rich in 
vaseline. The proportion of clay to the 
vaseline varies according to the desired 
consistency of the product, the admix- 
ture of vaseline varying from 10 to 50 
per cent. It is obvious that the hardness 
of the material decreases with the 
amount of vaseline added, so that the one 
richest in vaseline will be the softest. W 
the use of various varieties of clay ana 
the suitable choice of admixtures, tne 
plasticity, as well as the color of the mass, 
may be varied.

W P wool fat before beginning work. A 
, effective way or eliminating devel- 
Ver "r stains is to dip the finger tips occa- 
°' P «dlv during development into the 
d aring bath. It i-s best to use the 
tearing bath, with ample friction, be- 
f e resorting to soap, as the latter seems 
to have a fixing effect upon the stain. 
Lemon peel is useful for removing pyro 
stains, and so are the ammonium per- 
sulphate reducer and the thiocarbamide 
clearer. 

Xo Clean Very Soiled Hands. — In the 
morning wash in warm water, using a 
stiff brush, and apply glycerine. _ Re- 
peat the application two or three times 
during the day, washing and brushing an 
hour or so afterwards, or apply a warm 
solution of soda or potash, and wash in 
warm water, using a stiff brush as before. 
Finally, rub the hands with pumice or 
infusorial earth. There arc soaps made 
especially for this purpose, similar to 
ttose for use on woodwork, etc., in 
which infusorial earth or similar matter 
is incorporated. 

To Remove Nitric-Acid Stains.— One 
plan to avoid stains is to use rubber

Cleaning Gilded and Polychromed 

Work on Altars.— To clean bright gold 
a fine little sponge is used which is 
moistened but lightly with tartaric acid 
and passed over the gilding. Next go 
over the gilt work with a small sponge 
saturated with alcohol to remove all dirt. 
For matt gilding, use only a white flannel 
dipped in lye, and carefully wipe off the 
dead gold with this, drying next with a 
fine linen rag. To clean polyehromed 
work sponge with a lye of rain water, 
1,000 parts, and calcined potash, (P 
parts, and immediately wash off with „ 
clean sponge and water, so that the lye 
does not attack the paint too much.

in —To Remove Stains of Sulphate of 
copper, or of salts of mercury, silver or 
ffofd from the hands, etc., wash them first 
with a dilute solution either of ammonia, 
tod de, bromide, or cyanide of potasMum, 

stains are old ones they should first be 
rubbed with the strongest acetic add 
and then treated as above. 

Removal of Picric-Acid Stains.— I.— 
Recent stains of picric, acid may be re- 
moved readily if the stain is covered with 
a layer of magnesium carbonate, the car- 
bonate moistened with a httle water to 
form a paste, and the paste then rubbed 
over the spot. # 
jX —Apply a solution of 

Boric acid 4 parts 

Sodium benzoate. . .. 1 part 

Water 1°° P arts 

HI _Dr. Frieiir, of Besancon, recom- 
mends lithium carbonate for the removal 
of picric-acid stains from the skin or 
from linen. The method of using it is 
simply to lay a small pinch on the stain 
and moisten the latter with water. 1 resh 
stains disappear almost instantly, and 
old ones in a minute or two. 

To Remove Finger Marks from Books, 
etc. — I. — Pour benzol (not benzine or 
gasoline, but Merck's "c. p." crystalliz- 
able) on calcined magnesia until it be- 
comes a crumbling mass, and apply this 
to the spot, rubbing it in lightly, with the 
tip of the finger. When the benzol 
evaporates, brush off. Any dirt that re- 
mains can be removed by using a piece 
of soft rubber. 

II. — If the foregoing fails (which it 
sometimes, though rarely, does), try the 
following: Make a hot solution of sodium 
hydrate in distilled water, of strength of 
from 3 per cent to 5 per cent, according 
to the age, etc., of the stain. Have pre- 
pared some bits of heavy blotting paper 
somewhat larger than the spot to be re- 
moved; also, a blotting pad, or several 
pieces of heavy blotting paper. Lay the 
soiled page face downward on the blot- 
ting pad, then, saturating one of the bits 
of blotter with the hot sodium hydrate 
solution, put it on the stain and go over 
it with a hot smoothing iron. If one ap- 
plication does not remove all the grease 
or stain, repeat the operation. Then 
saturate another bit of blotting paper with 
a 4 per cent or 5 per cent solution of hy- 
drochloric acid in distilled water, apply 
it to the place, and pass the iron over it 
to neutralize the strong alkali. This process 
will instantly restore any faded writing 
or printing, and make the paper bright 
and fresh again. 



Glycerine as a Detergent.— For Ce r 

tain kinds of obstinate spots (such 
coffee and chocolate, for instance) therp 
is no better detergent than glycerine 
especially for fabrics with delicate colors' 
Apply the glycerine to the spot, with » 
sponge or otherwise, let stand a miu- 
ute or so, then wash off with water or 
alcohol. Hot glycerine is even more 
efficient than cold. 

CLEANING SKINS AND LEATHER: 

See also Leather. 

To Clean Colored Leather. — P our car- 
bon bisulphide on non-vulcanized gutta- 

Eercha, and allow it to stand about 24. 
ours. After shaking actively add more 
gutta-percha gradually until the sohition 
becomes of gelatinous consistency, 
This mixture is applied in suitable quan- 
tity to oil-stained, colored leather and 
allowed to dry two or three hours. The 
subsequent operation consists merely in 
removing the coat of gutta-percha from 
the surface of the leather — that is, Tub- 
bing it with the fingers, and rolling it off 
the surface. 

The color is not injured in the least by 
the sulphuret of carbon; only those 
leathers on which a dressing containing 
starch has been used look a little lighter 
in color, but the better class of leathers 
are not so dressed. The dry gutta-per- 
cha can be redissolved in sulphuret of 
carbon and used over again. 

To Clean Skins Used for Polishing 
Purposes.— First beat them thoroughly 
to get rid of dust, then go over the surface 
on both sides with a piece of good white 
soap and lay them m warm water in 
which has been put a little soda, JWS 
them lie here for 2 hours, then wash them 
in plenty of tepid water, rubbing taem 
vigorously until perfectly clean Lm

How to Clean a Panama Hat. — Seru 
with castile soap and warm water, 
nail brush being used as an aid to ge 
the dirt away. The hat is then placed in 
the hot sun to dry and in the course of 
two or three hours is ready for use. It 
will not only be as clean as when new, 
but it will retain its shape admirably. 
The cleaned hat will be a trifle stiff at 
first, but will soon grow supple under 
wear. , 

A little glycerine added to the rinsing 
water entirely prevents the stiffness and 
brittleness acquired by some hats in dry- 
ing, while a little ammonia in the wash- 
ing water materially assists in the scrub- 
bing process. Ivory, or, in fact, any 
good white soap, will answer as well as 
castile for the purpose. It is well to 
rinse a second time, adding the glycerine 
to the water used the second time. Im- 
merse the hat completely in the rinse 
water, moving it about to get rid of 
traces of the dirtv water. When the hat 
has been thoroughly rinsed, press out the 
surplus water, using a Turkish bath towel 
for the purpose, and let it rest on the 
towel when drying.

CLEANING PREPARATIONS AND METHODS 



JI Apply a mixture of 1 part oil of 

turpentine and 2 parts of ammonia. 
This is effective, even if the coatings 
withstand the strongest lye. The two 
liquids are shaken in a bottle until tUey 
mix like milk. The mixture is applied 
to the coating with a little oakum; after a 
few minutes the old paint can be wiped 
off. 

To Clean Brushes and Vessels of pry 
Paint (see also Brushes and Paints).— 
The cleaning of the brushes and ves- 
sels in which the varnish or oil paint had 
dried is usually done by boiling with 
soda solution. This frequently spoils the 
brushes or cracks the vessels if of glass; 
besides, the process is rather slow and 
dirty. A much more suitable remedy is 
amyl acetate, which is a liquid with a 
pleasant odor of fruit drops, used mainly 
for dissolving and cementing celluloid. 
If amyl acetate is poured over a paint 
brush the varnish or hardened paint dis- 
solves almost immediately and the brush 
is again rendered serviceable at once. If 
necessary, the process is repeated. For 
cleaning vessels shake the liquid about in 
them, which softens the paint so that it 
can be readily removed with paper. In 
this manner much labor can be saved. 
The amyl acetate can be easily removed 
from the brushes, etc., by alcohol or oil 
of turpentine. 

Varnish and Paint Remover, — Dis- 
solve 20 parLs of caustic soda (98 per 
cent) in 100 parts of water, mix the solu- 
tion with 20 parts of mineral oil, and stir 
in a kettle provided with a mechanical 
stirrer, until the emulsion is complete. 
Now add, with stirring, 20 parts of saw- 
dust and pass the whole through a paint 
mill to obtain a uniform intermixture. 
Apply the paste moist. 

To Remove Varnish from Metal. — To 
remove old varnish from metals, it suf- 
fices to dip the articles in equal parts of 
ammonia and alcohol (95 per cent). 

To Remove Water Stains from Var- 
nished Furniture. — Pour olive oil into a 
dish and scrape a little white wax into it. 
This mixture should be heated until 
the wax melts and rubbed sparingly on 
the stains. Finally, rub the surface with 
a linen rag until it is restored to bril- 
liancy, 

To Remove Paint, Varnish, etc., from 
Wood.— Varnish, paint, etc., no matter 
how old and hard, may be softened in a 
few minutes so that they can be easily 
scraped off, by applying the following 
mixture: 



Water glass 5 parK 

Soda lye, 40° B. (27 

percent). } t 

Ammonia water 1 part 

Mix. 

Removing Varnish, etc. — A 
has been taken out in England W 
liquid for removing varnish, lacquer t a E 
and paint. The composition is made h' 
mixing 4 ounces of benzol, 3 ounces I 
fusel oil, and 1 ounce of alcohol, It 
stated by the inventor that this mixture 
if applied to a painted or varnished sur- 
face, will make the surface quite clean in 
less than 10 minutes, and that a paint- 
soaked brush "as hard as iron" can be 
made as soft and pliable as new by 
simply soaking for an hour or so in the 
mixture. 

To Remove Enamel and Tin Solder.— 
Pour enough of oil of vitriol (concen- 
trated .sulphuric acid) over powdered 
fluorspar in an earthen or lead vessel, so 
as just to cover the parts whereby hydro- 
fluoric acid is generated. For use, dip 
the article suspended ou a wire into the 
liquid until the enamel or the tin is eaten 
away or dissolved, which does not injure

liquid acts more rapidly. The work 
should always be conducted in the open 
air, and care should be taken not to in- 
hale the fumes, which are highly inju- 
rious to the health, and not to get any 
liquid on the skin, as hydrofluoric acid 
is one of the most dangerous poisons. 
Hydrofluoric acid must be kept in earth-

jll -Ink spots may be removed by 
the following mixture: 

Oxalic acid.,.- 10 pars 

Stannic chloride.... * Pjrta 

Acetic acid & parts 

wSStomake...... 500 parts 

Mix- . 

TV — Tbe customary method ot cleans- 
ing ink spots is to use oxalic acid . 1 hick 
Wotting paper is soaked m a concen- 
trated I folutU and dried. It is then laid 
immediately on the blot, and m many 
Stances will take the latter out without 
leaving a trace behind. _ In more stub- 
born cases the cloth is dipped in boiling 
water and rubbed with crystals of oxalic 
acid after which it is soaked in a weak 
solution of chloride of lime— say 1 ounce 
to a quart of water. Under such circum- 
stances the linen should be thoroughly 
rinsed in several waters afterwards. 
Oxalic acid is undesirable for certain 
fabrics because it removes the color. 

y. — Here is a more harmless method: 
Equal parts of cream of tartar and citric 
acid, powdered fine, and mixed together. 
This forms the " salts of lemon " sold by 
druggists. Procure a hot dinner plate, 
lay the part stained in the plate, and 
moisten with hot water; next rub in the 
above powder with the bowl of a spoon 
until the stains disappear; then rinse in 
clean water and dry. 

To Remove Red (Aniline) Ink. — 
Stains of red anilines, except eosine, are 
at once removed by moistening with 
alcohol of 94 per cent, acidulated with 
acetic acid. Eosine does not disappear 
so easily. The amount of acetic acid to 
be used is ascertained by adding it, drop 
by_ drop, to the alcohol, testing the 
mixture from time to time, un'il when 
dropped on the stain, the latter -it once 
disappears.

Old 



Ceilings.— In dealing with old 
ceilings the distemper must be washed 
off down to the plaster face, all cracks 
raked out and stopped with putty (pl as . 
ter of Paris and distemper mixed), and 
the whole rubbed smooth with pumice 
stone and water; stained parts should be 
painted with oil color, and the whole 
distempered. If old ceilings are in bad 
condition it is desirable that they should 
be lined with paper, which should have 
a coat of weak size before being distem- 
pered. 

Oil Stains on Wall Paper.— Make a 
medium thick paste of pipe clay and 
water, applying it carefully flat upon the 
oil stain, but avoiding all friction. Tbe 
paste is allowed to remain 10 to 12 hours, 
after which time it is very carefully re- 
moved with a soft rag. In many cases a 
repeated action will be necessary until 
the purpose desired is fully reached. 
Finally, however, this- will be obtained 
without blurring or destroying the ^ 
sign of the wall paper, unless it be of W 
cheapest variety. In the case of a ligw, 
delicate paper, the paste should be com 
posed of magnesia and benzine. 

To Clean Painted Walls.-A 
method is to put a little aqua anijww 
in moderately warm water, da nap 
flannel with it, and gently wipe < oyer ^ 
painted surface. No scrubbing 
essary. 

Treatment of Whitewashed ^

*II —Mix 4 ounces of powdered pumice 
nuart of flour, and with the aid of 
later make a stiff dough. Form the 
dough into rolls 2 inches in diameter and 
6 inches long; sew each roll separately 
in a cotton cloth, then boil for 40 or 50 
minutes, so as to render the mass firm. 
Allow to stand for several hours, remove 
the crust, and they are ready for use. 

HI.— Bread will clean paper; but un- 
less it is properly used the job will be a 
very tedious one. Select a ' tin " loaf at 
least two days old. Cut of? the crust at 
one end, and rub down the paper, com- 
mencing at the top. Do not rub the 
bread backwards and forwards, but in 
single strokes. When the end gets dirty 
take a very sharp knife and pare off a 
thin layer; then proceed as before. 

It is well to make sure that the walls 
we quite dry before using the bread, or it 
may smear the pattern. If the room is

Hold a large pan or spread down a drirl 
doth to catch the bran as it falls b£ 
never use the same bran twice. Still 
another way is to use Canton flannel in 
strips a foot wide and about 3 yards 
1 a stri P around a stick 1 
inch thick and 10 inches long, so as to 
have the ends of the stick covered, with 
the nap of the cloth outside. As the 
cloth gets soiled, unroll the soiled part 
and roU it up with the soiled face inside. 

In this way one can change places on 
the cloth when soiled and use the whole 
face of the cloth. To take out a grease 
spot requires care. First, take several 
thicknesses of brown wrapping paper 
and make a pad, place it against the 
grease spot, and hold a hot flatiron 
against it to draw out the grease, which 
will soak into the brown paper. Be 
careful to have enough layers of brown 
paper to keep the iron from scorching or 
discoloring the wall paper. If the first 
application does not take out nearly all 
the grease, repeat with clean brown 
paper or a blotting pad Then take an 
ounce vial of washed sulphuric ether and 
a soft, fine, clean sponge and sponge the 
spot carefully until all the grease disap- 
pears. Do not wipe the place with the 
sponge and ether, but dab the sponge 
carefully against the place. A small 
quantity of ether is advised, as it is very 
inflammable.

If a paste is desired, a potash soap

the foregoing formula, and a portion or 
all of the water omitted. Soaps made 
from potash remain soft, while soda 
soaps harden on the evaporation of the 
water which they contain when first 
made. 

A liquid preparation may be obtained, 
of course, by the addition of sufficient 
water, and some more alcohol would 
probably improve it.

To Remove Spots from Tracing Clot 
— It is best to use benzine, which is ap- 
plied by means of a cotton rag. The 
benzine also takes off lead-pencil marks, 
but does not attack India and other ink 
The places treated with benzine shoul 
subsequently be rubbed with a littl

sible to use the pen on them. 

Removal of Paint from Clothing. 
Before paint becomes "dry" it can b

means of a tuft of cotton wool. Rubbing 
is to be avoided. 

Solution for Removing Nitrate of Sil- 
ver Spots. — 

Bichloride of mercury 5 parts 
Ammonium chloride. 5 parts 

Distilled water 40 parts 

Apply the mixture to the spots with a 
cloth, then rub. This removes, almost 
instantaneously, even old stains on linen, 
cotton, or wool. Stains on the skin thus 
treated become whitish yellow and soon 
disappear. 

Cleaning Tracings.— Tracing cloth 
can be very quickly and easily cleaned, 
and pencil marks removed by the use of 
benzine, which is applied with a cotton 
swab. It may be rubbed freely over the 
tracing without injury to lines drawn in 
ink, or even in water color, but the pencil 
marks and dirt will quickly disappear. 
The benzine evaporates almost immedi- 
ately, leaving the tracing unharmed. 
The surface, however, has been softened 
and must be rubbed down with talc, or 
some similar substance, before drawing 
any more ink lines. 

The glaze may be restored to tracing 
cloth after using the eraser by rubbing 
the roughened surface with a piece of 
hard wax from an old phonograph 
cylinder. The surface thus produced is 
superior to that of the original glaze, as 
it is absolutely oil- and water-proof.

To Clean Paintings. —To clean an oil 
painting, take it out of its frame, lay a 
niece of cloth moistened with rain water 
on it, and leave it for a while to take up 
the dirt from the picture. Several appli- 
cations may be required to secure a 
perfect result. Then wipe the picture 
very gently with a tuft of cotton wool 
damped with absolutely pure linseed oil. 
Gold frames may be cleaned with a 
freshly cut onion; they should be wiped 
with a soft sponge wet with rain water a 
few hours after the application of the 
onion, and finally wiped with a soft rag. 

Removing and Preventing Match 
Marks.— The unsightly marks made on 
a painted surface by striking matches on 
it can sometimes be removed by scrub- 
bing with soapsuds and a stiff brush. 
To prevent match marks dip a bit of 
flannel in alboline (liquid vaseline), and 
with it go over the surface, rubbing it 
hard. A second rubbing with a dry bit

STONE CLEANING: 

Cleaning and Polishing Marble.— 
I —Marble that has become dirty by 
ordinary use or exposure may be cleaned 
by a simple bath of soap and water. 

If this does not remove stains, a weak 
solution of oxalic add should be applied 
with a sponge or rag, washing quickly 
and thoroughly with water to minimize 
injury to the surface. 

Rubbing well after this with chalk 
moistened with water will, m a measure 
restore the luster. Another method ot 
finishing is to apply a solution of white 
wax in turpentine (about 1 in 10), rub- 
bing thoroughly with a piece of flannel 
or soft leather. 

If the marble has been much exposed, 
so that its luster has been seriously im- 
paired, it may be necessary to repolish 
it in a more thorough manner. This 
may be accomplished by rubbing it first 
with sand, beginning with a moderately 
coarse-grained article and changing this 
twice for finer kinds, after which tripoli 
or pumice is used. The final polish is 
given by the so-called putty powder. A 
plate of iron is generally used in applying 
the coarse sand; with the fine sand a 
leaden plate is used; and the pumice is 
employed, in the form of a smooth-surfaced 
piece of convenient sine. For the final 
polishing coarse linen or bagging is used, 
wedged tightly into an iron planing tool. 
During all these applications water is 
allowed to trickle over the face of the 
stone. 

The putty powder referred to is bin- 
oxide of tin, obtained by treating metal- 
lic tin with nitric acid, which converts 
the metal into hydrated metastannic acid. 
This, when heated, becomes anhydrous. 
In this condition it is known as putty 
powder. In practice putty powder is 
mixed with alum, sulphur, and other 
substances, the mixture used being de- 
pendent upon the nature of the stone to 
be polished. 

According to Warwick, colored mar- 
ble should not be treated with soap and 
water, but only with the solution of bees- 
wax above mentioned. 

II- — Take 2 parts of sodium bicarbon- 
ate, 1 part of powdered pumice stone, 
and 1 part of finely pulverized chalk. 
Pass through a fine sieve to screen out 
all particles capable of scratching the 
marble, and add sufficient water to form 



a pasty mass. Rub the marble with u 
vigorously, and end the cleaning 
soap and water. b Un

finally rubbing dry. It may be neces- 
sary to repeat this operation. 

V. — Wash the surface with a mixture 
of finely powdered pumice stone and vin- 
egar, and leave it for several hours; then 
brush it hard and wash it clean. When, 
dry, rub with whiting and wash leather.

Mix thoroughly and rub over the mar- 
ble with a piece of flannel, and leave it 
on for 24 hours, then wash it off with 
clean water, and polish the marble with 
a piece of flannel or an old piece of felt. 

VII. — A strong solution of oxalic acid 
effectually takes out ink stains. In 
handling it the poisonous nature of this 
acid should not be forgotten, 

VIII. — Iron mold or ink spots may 
be taken out in the following man- 
ner: Take I ounce of butter of antimony 
and 1 ounce of oxalic acid and dissolve 
them in 1 pint of rain water; add enough 
flour to bring the mixture to a proper 
consistency. Lay it evenly on tne 
stained part with a brush, and, alter it 
has remained for a few days, was Q it oir 
and repeat the process if the stain is not 
wholly removed.

mon clay saturated with benzine,

oliah will be injured, but the stam wiU

few inches of cold water— hot water 
renders marble dull— take a soft brush 
and a piece of Venetian soap, dip the 
former in the water and rub on the latter 
carefully, brushing off the article from 
top to bottom. When in this manner 
dust and dirt have been dissolved, wash 
off all soap particles by means of a water- 
in" pot and cold water, dab the object 
with a clean sponge, which absorbs the 
moisture, place it upon a cloth and care- 
fully dry with a very clean, soft cloth, 
rubbing gently. This treatment will 
restore the former gloss to the marble. 

XIII. — Mix and shake thoroughly in 
a bottle equal quantities of sulphuric acid 
and lemon juice. Moisten the spots and 
rub them lightly with a linen cloth and 
they will disappear. 

XIV. — Ink spots are treated with acid 
oxalate of potassium; blood stains by 
brushing with alabaster dust and dis- 
tilled water, then bleaching with chlorine 
solution. Alizarine ink and aniline ink 
spots can be moderated by laying on rags 
saturated with Javelle water, chlorine wa-

Preparation for Cleaning Marble^ 
Furniture, and Metals, Especially Cop- 
per. — This preparation is claimed to giv< 
very quickly perfect brilliancy, persisting 
without soiling either the hand or the 
articles, and without leaving any odor o\ 
copper. The following is the composi- 
tion for 100 parts of the product: Wax, 
2.4 parts; oil of turpentine, 9.4 parts; 
acetic acid, 42 parts; citric acid, 42 parts; 
white soap, 42 parts. 

Removing Oil Stains from Marble.— 
Saturate fuller's earth with a solution of 
equal parts of soap liniment, ammonia, 
and water; apply to the greasy part of 
the marble; keep there for some hours, 
pressed down with a smoothing iron 
sufficiently hot to warm the mass, and 
as it evaporates occasionally renew the 
solution. When wiped off dry the stain 
will have nearly disappeared. Some 
days later, when more oif works toward 
the surface repeat the operation. A tew 
such treatments should suffice.

leather or a brush, which will remove 
dirt grease, and other deleterious sub- 
stances. By rubbing gently with a 
cloth or piece of leather a polished sur- 
face will be imparted to wood, and ob- 
jects of metal will be rendered lustrous. 

The addition of chloride of hme tends 
to keep the paste moist, thus allowing the 
ready removal of the paste without dam- 
aging the varnish or polish, while the 
turpentine serves as a disinfectant and 
renders the odor less disagreeable during 
the operation. 

The preparation is rapid m its action, 
and does not affect the varnished or 
polished surfaces of wood or marble. 
While energetic in its cleansing action on 
brass and other metallic objects, it is 
attended with no corrosive effect. 

Nitrate of Silver Spots. — To remove 
these spots from white marble, they 
should be painted with Javelle water, 
and after having been washed, passed 
over a concentrated solution of thiosul- 
phate of soda (hyposulphite). 
I To Remove Oil-Paint Spots from 
Sandstones. — This may be done by 
washing the spots with pure turpentine 
oil, then covering the place with white 
argillaceous earth (pipe clay), leaving it 
to dry, and finally rubbing with sharp 
soda lye, using a brush. Caustic am- 
monia also removes oil-paint spots from 
sandstones. 

RUST REMOVERS: 

To Remove Rust from Iron or Steel 
Utensils. — 

I. — Apply the following solution by 
means of a brush, after having removed 
any grease by rubbing with a clean, dry 
cloth: 100 parts of stannic chloride are 
dissolved in 1,000 parts of water; this 
solution is added to one containing 2 
parts tartaric acid dissolved in 1,000 
parts of water, and finally 20 cubic cen- 
timeters indigo solution, diluted with 
2,000^ parts of water, are added. After 
allowing the solution to act upon the 
stain for a few seconds, it is rubbed clean, 
first with a moist cloth, then with a dry 
cloth; to restore the polish use is made of 
silver sand and jewelers' rouge. 

II. — When the rust is recent it is re- 
moved by rubbing the metal with a cork 
charged with oil. In this manner a per- 
fect polish is obtained. To take off old 
rust, mix equal parts of fine tripoli and 
flowers of sulphur, mingling this mixture 

Hub the iron with this preparation by 
means of a skin. 

— The rusty piece is connected 
With a piece of zinc and placed in water 



containing a little sulphuric acid Ah 
the articles have been in the liquirl t 
several days or a week, the rust will h 
completely disappeared. The lencth?! 
time will depend upon the depth f 
which the rust has penetrated. A liui 
sulphuric acid may be added from thV 
to time, but the chief point is that th* 
zinc always has good electric contalJ 
with the iron. To insure this an i T 
wire may be firmly wound around th* 
iron object and connected with the zin 
The iron is not attacked in the least a' 
long as the zinc is kept in good electric 
contact with it. When the articles are 
taken from the liquid they assume a dark 
gray or black color and are then washed 
and oiled. 

IV. — The rust on iron and steel ob- 
jects, especially large pieces, is readily 
removed by rubbing the pieces with oil 
of tartar, or with very fine emery and a 
little oil, or by putting powdered alum in 
strong vinegar and rubbing with this 
aluined vinegar. 

V. — Take cyanide of calcium, 25 
parts; white soap, powdered, 25 parts; 
Spanish white, 50 parts; and water, 20Q 
parts. Triturate all well and rub the 
piece with this paste. The effect will be 
quicker if before using this paste the 
rusty object has been soaked for 5 to 
10 minutes in a solution of cyanide of 
potassium in the ratio of 1 part of cya- 
nide to 2 parts of water. 

VI. — To remove rust from polished 
steel cyanide of potassium is excellent. 
If possible, soak the instrument to be 
cleaned in a solution of cyanide of potas- 
sium in the proportion of 1 ounce of cya- 
nide to 4 ounces of water. Allow this 
to act till all loose rust is removed, and 
then polish with cyanide soap. it e 
latter is made as follows: Potassium cya- 
nide, precipitated chalk, white castile 
soap. Make a saturated solution of tbe 
cyanide and add chalk sufficient to make 
a creamy paste. Add the soap cut in 
fine shavings and thoroughly incorporate 
in a mortar. When the mixture is sua 
cease to add the soap. It should be re- 
membered that potassium cyanide is 
virulent poison. , _„ 

VII. — Apply turpentine or ^eio^e 
oil, and after letting it stand over mg n - 
clean with finest emery cloth. _ i 

VIII. — To free articles of iron aiu 
steel from rust and imbedded grains . 
sand the articles are treated with tiu ^ 
hydric acid (about 2 per cent) i ^ 
hours, wherebvthe impurities bin j w 
metal are dissolved.' This is f° llo ^ ]ize

ments, which have been dried by leaving 
them In heated air, in this, moving their 
parts, if movable, as in forceps and scis- 
sors, about under the liquid, so that it 
may enter all the crevices. Next lay the 
lastruments on a plate in a dry room, so 
that the benzine can evaporate. Nee-

To Clean Petroleum Lamp Burners. — 
Dissolve in a quart of soft water an 
ounce or an ounce and a half of washing 
soda, using an old half-gallon tomato can. 
Into this put the burner after removing 
the wick, set it on the stove, and let it 
boil strongly for 5 or 6 minutes, then 
take out, rinse under the tap, and dry. 



Every particle of carbonaceous matt 
will thus be got rid of, and the burner h 
as clean and serviceable as new TV 
ought to be done at least every mon JJ. S 
but the light would be better if it wer 
done every 2 weeks. ~ 

Gold-Ware Cleaner. —

rouge, after first rubbing it up with a por- 
tion of the liquid. With a dean cloth 
wet with this mixture, go well over the 
article. Rinse off with hot water and 
dry. 

Silverware Cleaner.— Make a thin paste 
of levigated (not precipitated) chalk and 
sodium hyposulphite, in equal parts, 
rubbed up in distilled water. Apply 
this paste to the surface, rubbing well 
with a soft brush. Rinse in clear water 
and dry in sawdust. Some authorities 
advise the cleaner to let the paste dry oa 
the ware, and then to rub off and rinse 
with hot water. 

Silver-Coin Cleaner,-— Make a bath of 
10 parts of sulphuric acid and 90 parts of 
water, and let the coin lie in this until the 
crust of silver sulphide is dissolved. From 
5 to 10 minutes usually suffice. Rinse 
in running water, then rub with c soft 
brush and castile soap, rinse again, dry 
with a soft cloth, and then carefully rub 
with chamois.

To Remove Ink Stains on Silver. — 
Silver articles in domestic use, and espe- 
cially silver or plated inkstands, fre- 
quently become badly stained with ink. 
These 'stains cannot be removed by ordi- 
nary processes, but readily yield to a 
paste of chloride of lime and water. Ja-

Removing Egg Stains. — A pinch of table 
salt taken between the thumb and finger 
and rubbed on the spot with the end of 
the ringer will usually remove the darkest 
egg stain from silver. 

To Clean Silver Ornaments. — Make a 
strong solution, of soft soap and water, 
and in this boil the articles for a few min-

rub evenly oyer the part to be cleaned- 
or apply with a brush. Set the article 
aside and, next day, rub it well with a 
dry, woolen rag. Every particle of rust, 
resimfied grease, etc., will disappear 
provided the article has not been neglected 
too long. In this case a further applica- 
tion of the oil will be necessary. If too 
great pressure has not been made, or the 
rubbing continued too long, the residual 
oil finally leaves the surface protected by 
a delicate layer of paraffine that will pre- 
vent rusting for a long time. 

To Clean Articles of Nickel. — Laj 

them for a few seconds in alcohol con- 
taining % per cent of sulphuric acid; re- 
move, wash in running water, rinse in 
alcohol, and rub dry with a linen cloth. 
This process gives a brilliant polish and 
is especially useful with plated articleson 
the plating of which the usual polishing 
materials act very destructively. The 
yellowest and brownest nickeled articles 
are restored to pristine brilliancy by 
leaving them in the alcohol and acid for 
15 seconds. Five seconds suffice ordi- 
narily. 

How to Renovate Bronzes.— For gilt 
work, first remove all grease, dirt, wax, 
etc., with a solution in water of potas- 
sium or sodium hydrate then dry, and 
with a soft rag apply the following.

parts; distilled or rain water, 125 parts. 
Clean of grease, etc., as above, and apply 
the solution with a came s-bair pencil. 
Rinse off and dry in sawdust. hinaliy, 
some articles are best cleaned by im- 
mersing in hot soap suds and rubbing 
with a soft brush. Rinse in clear, hot 
water, using a soft brush to getthe residual 
suds out of crevices. Let dry, then brush 
by rubbing the gilt spots or places with a 
soft, linen rag, or a bit of chamois. _ _ 

There are some bronzes gilt with imi- 
tation gold and varnished Where the 
work is well done and the gilding has not 
been on too long, they will deceive even 
the practiced eye. The deception, how- 
ever may easily be detected by touching 
a spot on the gilt surface with a glass rod 
dipped in a solution of corrosive subli- 
mate. If the gilding is true no discolor- 
ation will occur, but if false a brown 
spot will be produced. 

To Clean a Gas Stove. — An easy meth- 
od of removing grease spots consists in 
immersing the separable parts for sev- 
eral hours in a warm lye, heated to about 
70° C. (158° F.), said lye to be made of 
9 parts of caustic soda and 180 parts of 
water. These pieces, together with the 
fixed parts of the stove, may be well 
brushed with this lye and afterwards 
rinsed in clean, warm water. The 
grease will be dissolved, and the stove 
restored almost to its original state. 

Cleaning Copper Sinks. — Make rot- 
ten stone into a stiff paste with soft soap 
and water. Rub on with a woolen rag, 
and polish with dry whiting and rotten 
stone. Finish with a leather and dry 
whiting. Many of the substances and 
mixtures used to clean brass will effec- 
tively clean copper. Oxalic acid is said 
to be the best medium for cleaning cop- 
per, but after using it the surface of the 
copper must be well washed, dried, and 
then rubbed with sweet oil and tripoli, or 
some other polishing agent. Otherwise 
the metal will soon tarnish again. 

Treatment of Cast-iron Grave Crosses. 
— The rust must first be thoroughly re- 
moved with a steel-wire brush. When 
this is done apply one or two coats of red 
lead or graphite paint. After this prim- 
ing has become hard, paint with double- 
burnt lampblack and equal parts of oil of 
turpentine and varnish. This coating 
ia followed by one of lampblack ground 
with coach varnish. Now paint the sin- 



gle portions with "mixtion" (o\U\ n 
oil) and gild as usual. Sueh crosS 
better when they are not altogeth^ 
black. Ornaments may be Tery wj 
treated in colors with oil paint and then 
varnished. The crosses treated in thk 
manner are preserved for many years 
but it is essential to use good exterior or 
coach varnish for varnishing, and not the 
so-called black varnish, which is mostly 
composed of asphalt or tar. * 

Cleaning Inferior Gold Articles.— The 
brown film which forms on low-quality 

fold articles is removed by coating with 
uming hydrochloric acid, whereupon 
they are brushed off with Vienna lime 
and petroleum. Finally, clean the ob- 
jects with benzine, rinse again in pure 
benzine, and dry in sawdust. 

To Clean Bronze. — Clean the bronze 
with soft soap; next wash it in plenty of 
water; wipe, let dry, and apply light en- 
caustic mixture composed of spirit of 
turpentine in which a small quantity of 
yellow wax has been dissolved. The en- 
caustic is spread by means of a linen or 
woolen wad. For gilt bronze, add 1 
spoonful of alkali to 3 spoonfuls of water 
and rub the article with this by means 
of a ball of wadding. Next wipe with a 
clean chamois, similar to that employed 
in silvering. 

How to Clean Brass and Steel.— To 
clean brasses quickly and economically, 
rub them with vinegar and salt or with 
oxalic acid. Wash immediately after 
the rubbing, and polish with tripoli and 
sweet oil. Unless the acid is washed oit 
the article will tarnish quickly. Cupper 
kettles and saucepans, brass andirons, 
fenders, and candlesticks and trays are 
best cleaned with vinegar and salt.

these different ingredients, which con- 
stitute a paste, -this is molded in order to 
give a cylindrical form, and introduced 
into a case so that it can be used like a 
stick of cosmetic. 

PutzPomade. — I. — Oxalic acid, 1 part; 
caput mortuum, 15 parts (or, if white 
pomade is desired, tripoli, 12 parts);

To Remove Silver Plating, I — P u t 

sulphuric acid 100 parts and potassiui 
nitrate (saltpeter) 10 parts in a vessel 
of stoneware or porcelain, heated on the 
water bath. When the silver has left the 
copper, rinse the objects several times. 
This silver stripping bath may be used 
several times, if it is kept in a well-closed 
bottle. When it is saturated with silver 
decant the liquid, boil it to dryness, thei 
add the residue to the deposit, and melti 
the crucible to obtain the metal. 

II. — Stripping silvered articles of tl 
silvering may be accompli shed by the fol 
lowing mixture: Sulphuric acid, 60 c 
3 parts; nitric acid, 40° B., 1 part; he 
the mixture to about 166° F., and ii 
merse the articles by means of a copt 
wire. In a few seconds the acid mixtui 
will have done the work. A thorouf 
rinsing off is, of course, necessary. 

To Clean Zinc Articles. — In order 
clean articles of zinc, stir rye bran intc 
paste with boiling water, and add a hai 
ful of silver sand and a little vitrii 
Rub the article with this paste, rinse wit 
water, dry, and polish with a cloth. 

To Remove Rust from Nickel.— S me: 
the rusted parts well with grease (ord 
narv animal fat will do), and allow 
article to stand several days. If 
rust is not thick the grease and rust mi 
be rubbed off with a cloth dipped in an 
monia. If the rust is very deep, apply 
diluted solution of hydrochloric aci< 
taking care that the acid does not touch 
the metal and the rust may be easily 
robbed off. Then wash the article and 
polish in the usual way.

moldings, and, in fact, all kinds of gilded 
work, the best medium is liquor potassce, 
diluted with about 5 volumes of water. 
Dilute alcohol is also excellent. Methylated 
wood spirit, if the odor is not objectionable, 
answers admirably. 

To Scale Cast Iron. — To remove the 
scale from cast iron use a solution of 1 
part vitriol and 2 parts -water; after mix- 
ing, apply to the scale with a cloth rolled 
in the iorni of a brush, using enough to 
wet the surface well. After 8 or 10 hours 
wash off with water, when the hard, scaly 
surface will be completely removed- 
Cleaning Funnels and Measures. — 
Funnels and measures used for measur- 
ing varnishes, oils, etc., may be cleaned 
by soaking them in a strong solution of 
lye or pearlash. Another mixture for 
the same purpose consists of pearlash 
with quicklime in aqueous solution. 
The measures are allowed to soak in the 
solution for a short time, when the resin- 
ous matter of the paint or varnish is 
easily removed. A thin coating of pe- 
troleum lubricating oils may be removed, 
it is said, by the use of naphtha or petro- 
leum benzine. 

To Clean Aluminum. — I. — Aluminum 
articles are very hard to clean so they will 
have a bright, new appearance. This is 
especially the case with the matted or 
frosted pieces. To restore the pieces to 
brilliancy place them for some time in 
water that has been slightly acidulated 
with sulphuric acid. 

■ II — Wash the aluminum with coal-oil, 
gasoline or benzine, then put it in a con- 
centrated solution of caustic potash, and 
after washing it with plenty of water, 
dip it in the bath composed of § nitric 
acid and ^ water. Next, subject it to a 
bath of concentrated nitric acid, and 
finally to a mixture of rum and olive oil. 
To render aluminum capable of being 
worked like pure copper, $ of oil of tur- 
pentine and ■£ stearic acid are used. 
For polishing by hand, take a solution of 
30 parts of borax and 1,000 parts of 
water, to which a few drops of spirits of 
ammonia have been added. 

How to Clean Tarnished Silver.—!.— 
If the articles are only slightly tarnished, 
mix 3 parts of best washed and purified 
chalk and 1 part of white soap, adding 
wate ^ lill a thin paste is formed, which 
should be rubbed on the silver with a dry 
brush, till the articles are quite bright. 
As a substitute, whiting, mixed with caus- 
tic ammonia to form a paste, may be 
used. This mixture is very effective, but 
it irritates the eyes and nose. 



II— Place the silver articles 5, . 
aluminum p an in which has been pi ac S 
a water solution of about 2 per 
washing soda. Allow to remain in ft- 
solution until clean then remove 2

V. — To remove spots from silver lav it 
for 4 hours in soapmakers' lye, then throw on 
fine powdered gypsum, moisten the latter 
with vinegar to cause it to adhere, dry 
near the fire, and wipe off. Next rub 
the spot with dry bran. This not only 
causes it to disappear, but gives extraor- 
dinary gloss to the silver. 

VI. — Cleaning with the usual fine 
powders is attended with some difficulty 
and inconvenience. An excellent result 
is obtained without injury to the silver by 
employing a saturated solution of hypo- 
sulphite of soda, which is put on with a 
brush or rag. The article is then 
washed with plenty of water. 

VII. — Never rise soap on silverware, 
as it dulls the luster, giving the article 
more the appearance of pewter than 
silver. When it wants cleaning, rub it 
with a piece of sof t leather and prepared 
chalk, made into a paste with pure water, 
entirely free from grit. 

To Clean Dull Gold. — I —Take 80 parts, 
by weight, of chloride of lime, and rub it 
up with gradual addition of water in a 
porcelain mortar into a thin, even paste, 
which is put into a solution of 80 parts, 
by weight, of bicarbonate of soda, and 20 
parts, by weight, of salt, in 3,000 parts, 
by weight, of water. Shake it, and let 
stand a few days before using. If *W 
preparation is to be kept for any lengt j 
of time the bottle should be placed, well 
corked, in the cellar. For use, lay the 
tarnished articles in a dish, pour toe 
liquid, which has previously been wei 
shaken, over them so as just to cover 
them, and leave them therein for a tew 
days.

put the objects in hot water, brush them 
carefully, and let them dry in the air; 
when they are quite dry rub the shining 
parts only with an old linen cloth or a 
soft leather, without touching the others. 

Stripping Gilt Articles. — Degilding or 
stripping gilt articles may be done by at- 
taching the object to the positive pole of 
a battery and immersing it in a solution 
composed of 1 pound of cyanide dissolved 
in about 1 gallon of water. Desilvering 
may be effected in the same manner. 

To Clean Tarnished Zinc. — Apply with 
a fag a mixture of 1 part sulphuric acid 
"With IS parts o£ water. Rinse the zinc 
^ith. clear water. 

Cleaning Pewter Articles. — Pour hot 
'ye of wood ashes upon the tin, throw on 
sand, and rub with a hard, woolen rag, 
£ a t felt, or whisk until all particles of dirt 
JjfVe been dissolved. To polish pewter 
Plates it is well to have the turner make

To Clean Files.— Files which have be- 
come clogged with tin or lead are 
cleaned by dipping for a few seconds intc 
concentrated nitric acid. To remove 
iron filings from the file cuts, a bath of 
blue vitriol is employed. After the files 
have been rinsed in water they are like- 
wise dipped in nitric acid. File-ridgea 
closed up by zinc are cleaned by im- 
mersing the files in diluted sulphuric 
acid. Such as have become filled with 
copper or brass are also treated with 
nitric acid, but here the process has to be 
repeated several times. The files should 
always be rinsed in water after the treat- 
ment, brushed with a stiff brush, and 
dried in sawdust or by pouring alcohol 
over them, and letting it burn off on the 
file.

Scale Pan Cleaner.— About the quick- 
est cleaner for brass scale pans is a solu- 
tion of potassium bichromate in dilute 
sulphuric acid, using about 1 part of 
chromate, in powder, to 3 parts of acid 
and 6 parts of water. In this imbibe a 
cloth wrapped around a stick (to protect 
the hands), and with it rub the pans. 
Do this at tap or hydrant, so that no time 
is lost in placing the pan in running 
water after having rubbed it with the 
acid solution. For pans not very badly 
soiled rubbing with ammonia water and 
rinsing is sufficient.

Dissolve the soap in the -warm water, 
using from 50 to 60 parts. Mix the ben- 
zol and benzine, and add the soap solu- 
tion, a little at a time, shaking up well 
after each addition. If the mixture is 
slow in emulsifying, add at one time from 
SO to 100 parts of warm water, and shake 
violently. Set the emulsion aside for a 
few days, or until it separates, then de- 
cant the superfluous water, and pour the 
residual pasty mass, after stirring it up 
well, into suitable boxes.

Removing Oil Spots from Leather. — 
To remove oil stains from leather, dab 
the spot carefully with spirits of sal am- 
moniac, and after allowing it to act for 
a while, wash with clean water. This 
treatment may have to be repeated a few 
times, taking care, however, not to injure 
the color of the leather. Sometimes the 
spot may be removed very simply by- 
spreading the place rather thickly with 
butter and letting this act for a few hours. 
N . ext sc . ra P e the butter with the point 
of a knife, and rinse the stain with soap 
and lukewarm water. 

To Clean Linoleum.— Rust spots and 
other stains can be removed from lino- 
leum by rubbing with steel chips. 

T° Remove Putty, Grease, etc., from 
Mate Glass.— To remove all kinds of 
greasy materials from glass, and to leave 
the latter bright and clean, use a paste 
made of benzine and burnt magnesia of 
such consistence that when the mass is 
pressed between the fingers a drop of 
benzine will exude. With this mixture 
and a wad of cotton, go over the entire 
surface of the glass, rubbing it well.

To Remove Spots from Drawings 
etc.— Place soapstone, fine meerschaum 
shavings, amianthus, or powdered mai? 
nesia on the spot, and, if necessary 1» T 
on white filtering paper, saturating it 
with peroxide of hydrogen. AJlow this 
to act for a few hours, and remove the 
application with a brush. If necessary 
repeat the operation. In this manner 
black coffee spots were removed from a 
valuable diagram without erasure by 
knife or rubber. 

WATCHMAKERS' AND JEWELERS' 
CLEANING PREPARATIONS: 
To Clean the Tops of Clocks in Re- 
pairing. — Sprinkle whiting on the top. 
Pour good vinegar over this and rub 
vigorously. Rinse in clean water and 
dry slowly in the sun or at the fire. A 
good polish will be obtained. 

To Clean Watch Chains.— Gold or 
silver watch chains can be cleaned with 
a very excellent result, no matter whether 
they be matt or polished, by laying them 
for a few seconds in pure aqua ammonia; 
they are then rinsed in alcohol, and 
finally shaken in clean sawdust, free from 
sand. Imitation gold and plated chains 
are first cleaned in benzine, then rinsed 
in alcohol, and afterwards shaken in dry 
sawdust. Ordinary chains are first 
dipped in the following pickle: Pure 
nitric acid is mixed with concentrated 
sulphuric acid in the proportion of 10 
parts of the former to 2 parts of the latter; 
a little tabic salt is added. The chains 
are boiled in this mixture, then rinsed 
several times in water, afterwards in 
alcohol, and finally dried in sawdust.

ftilt Zinc Clocks.— It frequently hap- 
nTthat clocks of gilt zinc become 
p Ld with green spots. To remove 
IS spots the following process is used: 
S3 a small wad of cotton in alkali and 
rub it on the spot. The green color will 
^appear at once, but the gliding being 
°;f a black spot will remain. Wipe 
off well to remove all traces ot the alkali. 
To replace the gilding, put on, by means 
of liquid gum arabic, a little bronze pow- 
der of the color of the gilding % The 
powdered bronze is applied dry with the 
aid of a brush or cotton wad. When the 
gilding of the clock has become black or 
dull from age, it may be revived by im- 
mersion in a bath of cyanide of potas- 
sium, but frequently it suffices to wash it 
with a soft brush in soap and water, in 
which a little carbonate of soda has been 
dissolved. Brush the piece in the lather, 
rinse in clean water, and dry in rather 
hot sard list. The piece should be dried 
well inside and outside, as moisture will 
cause it to turn black. 

To Clean Gummed Up Springs. — 

Dissolve caustic soda in warm water, 
place the spring in the solution and leave 
it there for about one half hour. Any 
ou still adhering may now easily be 
taken off with a hard brush; next, dry the 
ynng with a clean cloth. In this man-

To Restore the Color of a Gold or Gil 
Dial. — Dip the dial for a few seconds i 
the following mixture: Half an ounce < 
cyanide of potassium is dissolved in 
quart of hot water, and 2 ounces o 
strong ammonia, mixed with J an oune 
of alcohol, are added to the solution. O 
removal from this bath, the dial shoul 
immediately be immersed in warm water, 
then brushed with soap, rinsed, an 
dried in hot boxwood dust. Or it ma 
simply be immersed in dilute nitric aei 
but in this case any painted figures wil 
be destroyed. 

A Bath for Cleaning Clocks.— In a 
enameled iron or terra- cotta vess 
pour 2,000 parts of water, add 50 par 
of scraped Marseilles soap, 80 to 10 
parts of whiting, and a small cup < 
spirits of ammonia. To hasten the pro
