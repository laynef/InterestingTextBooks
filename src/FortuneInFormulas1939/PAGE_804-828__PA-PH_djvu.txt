To Get More Gloss and Body in 
Paints. — ■ 

By passing air through linseed and 
other oils what is known as Blown Oil 
is obtained. It appears to have more 
body but in reality this is false for it 
does not have. It does produce a paint 
with more gloss and one which will dry 
more rapidly and is being used very 
extensively today by leading paint man- 
ufacturers. 



TOUCH UP BLACK. 

The simplest way to make up a touch 
up Black is to purchase a high grade 
quality of clear outside coach varnisn, 
one that will stand the weather fairly 
well. There are any number of Ornish 
makers who will sell you very reasonably 
what you need. 

If you get it in five gallon cans you 
can get a real good FOUR 
Varnish (dries in four hours) 1° 
around $1.25 a gallon. To this yoj 
simplv add from five to eight ounces o 
Carbon Black ground fine in Japan anj 
stir it up and this will give you a *°. u 
up Black. This will dry quicker than tou 
hours because the pigment causes 
film to dry faster. It actually sett i ' F 
in an hour so that in that amount of ti 
it will be practically dust free. V

TOP DRESSINGS. 

There are two kinds particularly of 
j i J nffS , Lacquer Type and Varnish 
S From these types hundreds of 
formulas originate, some good and some 
poor. 

VARNISH TYPE DRESSING. 

To a gallon of LONG OIL OUTSIDE 
SPAR Varnish add 6 ounces of Carbon 
Slack ground in Japan. Some finishers 

dd a Ys P int of linseed oil t0 this but 
ff your varnish Is long in oil enough you 
need not do this. The linseed or china 
wood oil gives the film more flexibility 
as does Castor Oil. Soya Bean and 
Fish Oil are also good especially the lat- 
ter but it smells too much. The higher 
the gloss you want the less Black you 
add. 

LACQUER TYPE DRESSING. 

It's cheaper to buy a ready made Lac- 
quer Solution than to make it yourself 
if you just are going to make up some 
top dressings. Get the following for- 
mulas: 10 ounces Cotton, 8 ounces Ester 
Gum in a gallon of 25% Butyl Acetate, 
35% Butyl Alcohol, 40% Toluol. To this 
add 3 or 3% ounces finely ground Car- 
bon Black. Then after you have added 
the Black and stirred it in with a gallon 
of Clear Lacquer, you add Yi pint lin- 
seed or china wood oil to give the film 
flexibility. Castor Oil is sometimes used 
but is not so good for out door exposure. 

COMMERCIAL PUTTY.

NEW DISCOVERIES IN PHOTOGRAPHY 



Prepared by 
ADRIAN and JEANNETTE LEROY 
of the 

International Research Laboratories 
1612 Neptune Avenue, Brooklyn, N. Y. 



DEFECTS IN PHOTOGRAPHIC 
WORK: 

The professional, as well as the ama- 
teur, sometimes have noticed that dur- 
ing their work, certain photographic de- 
fects make their appearance. It is 
sometimes hard to ascertain the course 
of these defects. We have therefore 
prepared a very simple system of analy- 
sis, for example: 

Different Kinds of Stains. — A whit- 
ish, powdery scum which appears on the 
negative after fixing, may be a precipita- 
tion of hypo, and can be removed simply 
by rewashing the negative very care- 
fully. If this does not remove it, it is 
probably a precipitation of aluminum 
sulphite sludge in the use of an alum- 
acid fixing in which the alkaline devel- 
oper carried into the bath has neutralized 
the acid content. This can usually be 
removed by soaking the plate or film 
in a 5 per cent bath of sodium carbonate 
and washing thoroughly. Should the tem- 
perature be above 65° F., it is best to 
harden the film first in a 3 per cent solu- 
tion of formalin and then wash it before 
using the sodium carbonate bath. 

Yellowish White Opalescence. — This 
gives the negative an appearance of be- 
ing made on white celluloid or opal 
glass. This may be the result of a 
warm hypo bath, or a bath containing 
too little sulphite, or too much acid. A 
fresh sulphur stain of this kind can be 
removed by first soaking the negative 
in a 8 per cent solution of a formalin 
to harden the film, for 2 or 3 minutes, 
then by washing it thoroughly and so ak- 
in ^ in a 10 per cent solution of sodium 
sulphite at a temperature of 100° to 
120° F. 



Silvery White Opalescence. — This is 
sometimes a result of a negative which 
is dried by means of denatured alcohol 
with the aid of a heat, and is usually 
removed very easily by rewashing the 
negative with water and drying it at a 
normal temperature. The same method 
will remove the opalescence if it is 
caused too strong a hypo or acid con- 
tent in a fixing bath. If stains are due 
to the presence of iron particles in the 
fixing bath, indelible pencil marks, ani- 
line dyes, etc., they are best removed by 
bleaching the negative first, and then 
redeveloping it by any of the methods 
described on these pages. 

How to Remove Hypo from a Nega- 
tive. — It is most important that the film, 
after the development, should be per- 
fectly free from any trace of hypo. The 
best way to insure this is to apply » 
weak solution of potassium permangan- 
ate to the film repeatedly. In order to 
prepare a sufficient vohime of perman- 
ganate solution, dissolve 8 grains of po- 
tassium permanganate in 128 ounces of 
water. After fixing and rinsing the 
negative, soak it in a few ounces or 
permanganate solution. When the P' 11 *" 
ish color disappears, this will show the 
presence of hypo in the film. The faded 
solution should be poured off, and fresh 
solution should be poured over the nega- 
tive. This method should be repeated 
about six times, or until the perman- 
ganate solution no longer loses its pu» 
color, which will prove that no trace ot 
hypo remains in the film. The way to 
obtain the best results with this method 
is to use a weak solution as given above, 

'ckiy- 



and to change the solution in use quic klj 
Tf you allow the negative to remain i f

inr on the tip of a brush. Although 
! ifSffl eliminate these spots, it is best 
to prevent them entirely. 

Cnt* Which are Clear and Trans- 

oa reC-These spots are sharply denned 
S ""regular in shape, and are caused 
of dust Wh is on the surface of the 
3m during its exposure. _ Dark spots are 
caused by dust particles m the film, usu- 
ally particles of black enamel or metal 
from the metal sheaths in which cut 
films and plates are carried. Both varie- 
ties are usually found in negatives made 
on plates and films which are carried 
on motor and cycling trips. When work- 
ing under such conditions, the best way 
to keep the camera, sheaths, holders and 
magazines free from dust, is to use a 
slightly dampened or chemically pre- 
pared dustless cloth very carefully^ be- 
fore filling the holders or putting m a 
new film spool. 

Spots of Angular Shape —These are 
caused by scum which sometimes torms> 
on the surface of the developing solu- 
tion. When this is disturbed, it breaks 
up into small angular particles, whicn 
cung to the film, causing the spots des- 
cribed. 

Small Transparent Holes —These are 
circular in shape with a clearly detmea 
outline, and are due to air-pockets which 
nave remained on the film during tlie 
development. If they are removed dur- 
ing the course of development, they 
usually leave their impressions, not very 
clearly outlined but requiring attention 
^ preparing the negative for printing. 
These air-pockets are caused by diluting 
the developing solution with tap water, 
u > actively rocking the tray, or tlie 



unskillful immersion of plates in a tank. 
It is advisable to keep a bottle of boiled 
water at hand for diluting developing 
solutions, and to lightly swab the film 
surface with a wet pad of cotton-wool 
right after immersing the plate or film in 
the developer. If air-pockets remain 
throughout the development and fixation, 
there is usually a little opaque center to 
the transparent spot, which is due to un- 
dissolved silver bromide. Lift this out 
with the knife and fill the hole with 
color matching the rest of the negative. 

Small Dark Spots— These are often 
due to particles of chemical dust or dry 
developer falling on the film during de- 
velopment, or to undissolved particles of 
the developer in the developing solution. 
This will usually happen when the devel- 
oping agent is added "dry" just before 
use, as in the case of pyro and amidol 
developers. The sludge found in devel- 
oping solutions after repeated _ use, 
sometimes gives rise to dark spots in th 
negative, as iron rust will from wate 
supply pipes. If you use care an 
cleanliness in the use of solutions, tray 
and in mixing developers 
room, you will without a doubt preven 
such troubles. 

Yellow or Brown Spots.-These ar

T^—Fof? is a more or less dense 
vcffi or deposit over the negative 
Kef which is easily distinguished troci 
the less severe veiling or flattening of 
the contrasts in the negative resulting 
from over-exposure and under-develop- 
ment, may be general or local, and be 
due to light or chemical action. 

Diffused Light Fog.— This fog or 
veil which covers the whole negative and 
which is fairly even in density, may be 
caused by dust or moisture on the lens 
scattering the light passed by the lens 
reflections from the camera bellows when 
a large aperture lens of greater covering 
power than is required by the plate is 
used; light glare from the use of a large 
aperture lens with little or no front 
flange or hood protection in a strong 
liriit- pinholes or minute breaks m the 
bellows of the camera or light leaking 
into the camera through an dl-ntting 
front board or lens flange, or at the 
space between the camera back and the 
plateholder or fllmpack adapter or the 
back cover of a rollfilm camera. If the 
fog is centered on the plate or film in 
the form of a vignetted disk, this may 
be the result of an imperfectly closing 
shutter resulting from dust between the 
shutter leaves plus strong direct light. 
A circular patch of fog, due to lens flare, 
sometimes appear in negatives made 
against the light, as in an interior where 
the lens faces dark detail between two 
windows, If using a lens hood does not 
eliminate this fault, the lens should be 
returned to the maker for examination. 
General light fog as ahove described, 
due to light leakage in the camera, is 
clearly shown by the edges of the plate 
or film, protected by the rebate of the 
holder or sheath, remaining clear and 
free from the defect in development. 

Local and Direct Fog. — This fog is 
very often so dense that it blots out the 
image where it strikes the plate. This 
usually comes from light leaking through 
a hole or defect in the plate box or film 
package, from defective plateholders or 
fllmpack cases, or from rough handling 
°* nbnpacks or carelessness in loading 
the filmspool in the camera in bright 
light or preparing the film for develop- 
ment. In the last two instances, the 
light creeps in at the edges of the film, 
ana the direction of the fog streak 
plainly shows its origin. When the f off 
patch begins at the lower edge of the 
negative and spreads with decreasing 
density, this shows that light reached 
ftlm wll cn the slide of the plate 



holder was roughly withdrawn or rein- 
serted after exposure, the velvcted light- 
stop being forced apart by the twist 
given to the slide. Similarly a sharply 
defined light patch on a plate negative 
indicates a small hole or crack in the 
holder slide. Giving an "instantaneous" 
exposure with the shutter set at "time" 
or "bulb"; using a much larger lens 
aperture instead of the small aperture 
for which the exposure was calculated; 
and exposing the film to strong light 
between development and fixing, are 
other causes of general light fog. 

Chemical Fog. — This fog is a thick 
veil which covers the whole plate or film, 
setting in during development, and may 
be due to many causes; such as metal 
magazines or holders varnished with a 
substance containing turpentine or other 
destructive varnishes ; an unsafe dark- 
room ligbt, due to the leakage of white 
light in the room while the plates or 
films are being loaded or developed, or 
dye which has faded; the use of a devel- 
oper at too high a temperature in devel- 
opment, or a developer containing 
caustic or other alkali in excess, or too 
large an amount of sodium sulphite in 
the developer, or the mixing of the 
developing solution while the plate is 
being developed, or the contamination 
of the developing solution with hypo or 
from old or cracked or unclean trays. 
Plates and films which have been stored 
in a warm, damp basement, are subject 
to various gases which are very liable to 
show chemical fog, in development. 

Troubles Resulting from Hot Weath- 
er. — Faults such as frilling, reticulation, 
graining, mottling, the softening or ac- 
tual running of the film, or the sudden 
appearance of a crop of minute blisters, 
are difficult to remedy, but they can be 
easily avoided by a little thought and 
care 'in negative making during the Slim- 
mer months or under tropical conditions. 

Frilling— This is the separation of 
small areas of the film from its support- 
ing base, almost always at the edges 01 
the picture image. Some plates are mo 
prone to this fault than others, but : mo* 
plates will frill in very hot weather 
carelesslv handled with warm fingers, ^ 
if subjected to long immersion in 
warm solution and then transferred * 
much colder solution, or transfer ^ 
from a strongly alkaline developer 
a cold acid fixing bath, or if Ie " tcr 
wash under a tap so that the w 
strikes it edgewise. To prevent fnin b

wK after development, soak it m the 
Smug bath for three minutes again 
Eg it before placing it m the acid 
Sag bath-which is always preferable 
to a plain fixing bath in hot weather. 

Mottling —The appearance of irregu- 
lar slmpel patches, lighter in density 
than the rest of the film, is more apt to 
appear in hot weather development than 
at other seasons. This is caused by the 
failure to keep the developer moving 
over the whole film, or by adding new 
developer or dry pyro to the working 
solution in the tray during development. 

Reticulation.— Graining of the ftlra is 
caused by transferring the plate or mm 
from a cool solution, or a hardener, to 
a warm solution, as in washing the plate 
in water warmer than the fixing bath. 
Too much washing, or the use of too 
Tapid a stream of water in a wann dark- 
room will sometimes cause this trouble. 



Blistering. Covering the image with 
a network of minute blisters, comes from 
the same causes outlined above, and is 
often a result of putting the plate to 
dry without first wiping the surface witn 
a semi-dry swab of cotton-wool, to re- 
move some of the over-abundant wet- 
ness of the film. 

The Fixing Bath.— This needs careful 
attention in the summertime, and snouiu 
be renewed quickly as soon as it appears 
Jo be weakening, which can be ascer- 
tained by its slow action. A weak nxing 
bath causes many troubles; mottling, 
^even density patches, brown mark- 
m gs, and etc. Do not try to strengthen 



an old fixing bath by adding fresh hypo. 
Make up a fresh bath. A good acid fix- 
ing bath for the summer is made up as 
follows : Mix in the order given. Water, 
100 ounces j sulphuric acid, 3 drams 
(added a few drops at a time) ; sodium 
sulphite (cryst.), 4 ounces. When thor- 
oughly dissolved, add chrome alum 2 
ounces, previously dissolved in 20 ounces 
of water. Finally make the bulk of the 
bath up to 160 ounces by adding water. 
Let the negative remain in this fixing 
bath fully 15 minutes after the film is 
completely cleared. 

Double Exposures. — Sometimes one 
is surprised to find two separate and 
distinct picture images on the same 
plate or film; a house with a boat sail- 
ing serenely across it; a bridge with 
a house right in the middle of it. This 
mistake was simply caused when yo 
forgot to change the plate by reversin- 
the holder if double plateholders are i 
use, or did not put in a new holder i 
single holders are used; or forget to pi 
a new plate or film into position if yo 
use a filmpack, or neglected to wind 
new film into position if you use a rol 
film camera. One is very apt to ove 
look this vital detail when ones atte 
tion is distracted right after an exp 
sure. 

The Kemedy.-In the case ! of the ro 
film camera, just get into the habit 
wSding a new film into position ngh 
™cr each exposure or, when

a magazine pl* te 



carrying the plate may have dropped 
into the well of the base before exposure, 
in which case we will probably have a 
double exposure on the next following 
plate in the series. If we are using a 
nlmpack, we may have pulled two tabs, 
and so put an exposed plate in the back 
ready for development before exposing. 
If it is a rollfllm camera with an unex- 
posed section of film ready for exposure, 
a rewinding fust before exposure will 
have the same result. The only time to 
•wind a new section of film ready for 
exposure is after each succeeding ex- 
posure has been made. Whether plates 
or films are in use the failure of the 
Shutter to open will give us a blank 
plate or film, which failure may be due 
to the mechanism of the shutter or lack 
of action in the release. Finally, a devel- 
oper compounded without some essential 
chemical, such as an alkali or the devel- 
oping agent Itself, will give us a blank. 

To Err is Human —Think first be- 
fore you work. Plan your work. Never 
run until you get on the right road be- 
cause you may have to go back a long 
way. 

DEVELOPERS 

PHOTOGRAPHIC DEVELOPING: 

Developing is perhaps the most im- 
portant as well as the most interesting 
part of photography. 

Professor Einstein once stated that it 
is more valuable and more important to 
know "WHY" you put the various in- 
gredients in a pot than to just know 
"HOW" to put them in; and it is true, 
for when one knows "WHY" they are 
put in, he then has the controlling factor 
in his hand, and can, at will, change the 
formulas with perfect safety to suit any 
particular or unusual experiment. 

It is for this reason that we first ex- 
plain "why" all the ingredients are 
needed for developing, and what their 
r6 x?l ° r combined actions are. 

When a film is exposed to an object 
through the lens of a camera, some ac- 
tion takes place on the surface of the 
mm. The action is very minute and 
cannot be seen by the naked eye or even 
through a microscope, for the image 
taken up" by the silvers in the emulsion 
f ^viable, and is photo graphical^

aucer- (the developing agent) ; third, the 



"Restrainer" (bromides) ; fourth, the 
"Preserver" (sulphites). 

The exposure of the film to light 
merely starts what is called a primary 
"reduction" which is invisible, as has 
been stated, and this action started by 
the light must be carried on and com- 
pleted by the chemicals in the developing 
solution to form a visible image of black 
silver. 

The "Pioneer" is the alkali which may 
come in the form of sodium carbonate or 
a similar salt. The alkali precedes the 
actions of the other chemicals in the 
solution and attacks the gelatin that 
embodies the silver halides (the light 
sensitive silver salts). It causes the gel- 
atin to soften and swell, enabling the 
developing agents to penetrate to the 
silver halide particles embedded in the 
gelatine. These developing agents are 
salts in the solution that have the power 
to force the silver to break its bond with 
the halide and become metallic silver. 
This change is termed "reduction." De- 
veloping agents affect all silver halide 
particles alike, whether they are partially 
reduced by light or not, and tend to 
reduce them all to metallic silver. To 
prevent this, a restrain er, (a bromide 
salt) is added. This salt makes the 
developer sensitive to just the silver 
halides in the image. 

It is well to remember that a reducing 
agent will attack all the silver halides in 
the emulsion and cause them to blacken 
without regard for the latent image al- 
ready formed by the light through the 
camera lens. To make the reducing 
agent selective, that is to limit its action 
to only those silver halides in the latent 
image, a restraining chemical is mixed 
with the solution. The rcstrainer slows 
up the reducing action of the developing 
agent and gives the photographer op- 
portunity to control the developing to 
a certain extent. 

There are a large number of salts cap- 
able of reducing silver salts but they 
cannot all be used because they cannot 
be made selective nor the speed of re- 
duction be controlled. Of the reducing 
agents that can be controlled and made 
selective, the most commonly used a 
pyro, hydroquinonc, metol, and amidol- 
Thev all combine readily with (*xj& D * 
but as they are f airlv neutral salts, tflcy 
will not act except in an alkaline _ son - 
tion. Thus, we see that the alkali in tn 
developer has two distinct actions, v ■> 
softening the gelatin, and furnishing w 
alkalinity so that the reducing a ^ ce 
might combine with oxygen and red

We now understand that a deve oping 
solution must contain a "reducer, and 
an alkaline agent to permit its action by 
Cftening the gelatin. Then too, it must 
contain a restraining agent which pio- 
tects the unaffected^ silver halides from 
reducing or blackening. i 

There is, however, another important 
point in developers that we must not 
overlook. All the above mentioned in- 
gredients in the developers would last 
but a few hours in solution unless a 
"preserver" was added. All the reduc- 
ing agents have an affinity for the oxy- 
gen of the air, which becomes dissolved 
in the water, and thus oxidation takes 
place, the solution becomes discolored, 
and all the prints or negatives developed 
in such a solution are stained and 
ruined. 

Sodium Sulphite has even a greater 
affinity for oxygen than any of the other 
ingredients in developers, and yet it is 
used as a preserver. It acts as a pre- 
server by taking the oxygen from the 
solution and forming sodium sulphate, 
thereby protecting the solution from 
deterioration but at the same time tak- 
ing no part at all in the chemical action 
of developing. There are other preserv- 
ing agents used in developing solutions 
ia place of sodium sulphite, these being, 
generally, bisulphites or metabisulphites 
of potassium or sodium. 

We have mentioned all these things to 
teach yon. wn y the various ingredients 
are used in developers, and when you are 
fading over the formulas given for de- 
veloper^ you w nj readily understand why 
!J e various chemicals are used and what 
tfl eir respective actions and effects will 



be. Before entering into the formulas, 
here is a "trouble chart" that will enable 
you to locate the causes of your troubles 
in defective developing. 

TROUBLE CHART: 

Fogging. — Caused by accidental ex- 
posure of the paper or film to actinic 
light; or, deterioration of the paper or 
film through age (look foT the expiration 
date on the box) ; or, insufficient bromide 
in the developer ; or, too much carbonate 
in the developer, thus causing an over- 
reduction of the silver salts (the addition 
of more bromide will overcome this) ; or, 
impure chemicals (always buy chemicals 
that are prepared especially for photo- 
graphic use; or, improper mixing of the 
chemicals in the solution. Be sure you 
add the chemicals in the OTder in which 
they are given in the formula. The use 
of warm water aids in dissolving the 
chemicals, but heat accelerates their de- 
composition and it must be remembered 
that no formula should be mixed with 
water warmer than 125° F. unless other 
Wise specified in the formula. 

Discolored Developing Solutions. 

Insufficient sulphite to prevent oxidation 
or, too much carbonate, impurity of in

Frilling and Blistering.— This is gen- 
erally caused either by the excess of 
alkali In the developer, or the high tem- 
perature of the solutions through which 
the films pass. If you are in hot climate, 
U i, advisable to use the f Tropical De- 
veloper, formula D.13 » Another method 
is to treat the films, papers, and plates 
with an 8 per cent solution of formalin 
for 2 or 3 minutes before putting into 
the developer. Of course, this must be 
done in a darkroom. In the case of too 
much or too strong an alkali, it is best to 
mix proper solutions and discard the old. 
The developing solutions should never 
xceed 73° F. while in use. 
Improper Mixingf— The chemicals 
should be mixed in the order stated m 
the formula as has been stated before, 
but as this is of such signal importance, 
it hears repeating. Also they should 
not be mixed in water warmer than 
125° F. unless the formula specifics it. 
The preserver must always be added be- 
fore the alkali. If this is not done the 
alkali attacks and decomposes the devel- 
oping agent and renders the solution 
useless. 

FINE GRAIN DEVELOPING: 

Fine grain developing is an important 
factor of the present day camera. En- 
largements made from small films will 
show "grain" and coarseness unless the 
films are developed in fine grain de- 
veloper. 

A photographic film consists essentially 
of an emulsion of silver bromide, and sil- 
ver bromide is made by adding potas- 
sium bromide to silver nitrate. Iodide 
mixed with silver makes silver iodide, 
chloride with silver makes silver chloride, 
and so on, all down the line. The silver 
bromide particles are the sensitive agents 
in photographic films, just as silver chlo- 
ride is the sensitive agent in our printing 
paper. These bromide particles are en- 
cased in gelatine walls (just like honey 
is encased in beeswax). These little cells 
are like thousands and thousands of 
small mirrors packed closely together. 
They resemble mirrors in many ways, for 
both have silver nitrate as their medium 
of light absorption. When the film is 
exposed to light in a camera, the lens acts 
somewhat like a telescope or pair of field 
glasses does to the human eye. It con- 
denses the picture, the light strikes the 
bromide cells and as far as the action of 
the camera is concerned, it is finished. 
The next step is developing the film. 



The action of the developer on the film 
simply removes the bromide from the 
silver, and at the same time converts the 
remaining silver into "black metallic sil- 
ver" which forms the image that the 
camera has "taken." This image, of 
course, is made up of grains, because the 
original emulsion consisted of micro- 
scopic crystal cells. 

When the action of the developer re- 
moves the bromide from these cells, the 
cells break up, due to the water in the 
developer, causing the gelatine to absorb 
water and become soft. Thus, the silver 
bromide is fully exposed to the action of 
the developer, and the so-called reduction 
of the silver takes place. Now it is at this 
point that the present day FINE 
GRAIN developers play their important 
role. 

The action of the developer in causing 
the casing of gelatine that had previously 
enclosed the silvers to break down, al- 
lows the silvers, minus their bromide, to 
become "wild." As they have a mag- 
netic attraction for each other, they 
build up in CLUMPS in the craters of 
what were gelatine cells (or crystalline 
shells that encased the original silver 
bromide microscopic grains). 

These craters are brought about by the 
so-called "boiling action" of the encased 
silvers. 

This "boiling action," or eruption, of 
the encased silvers in their dried crystal 
gelatine cells, takes place due to two 
things; the action of the light on the 
cells when the film was exposed in the 
camera, and the action of the developer. 

The action of light with which we are 
chiefly concerned at this present moment 
is a photo chemical action resulting in 
the decomposition of the compounds (the 
silvers), to be followed later with a 
chemical action of the developer. 

It is well known that under the influ- 
ence of light such elements as sulphur 
and phosphorus gradually become trans- 
formed into their so-called "allotropic 
modifications, ordinary phosphorus be- 
coming red, or amorphous, and a s t^°"^ 
solution of sulphur in carbon di sulphide 
slowly depositing the insoluble modifica- 
tion when exposed to sunlight in a seaIe , 
tube. So also certain metallic salts, sucn 
as the crystalline chloride iodide or bro- 
mide of silver, nickel sulphate and zinc 
selena te, experience a change in crysta - 
line form under the influence of hfe™ ; 
Regarded as a chemical agent, light 
produce both combination and deconip« ' 
sition, although it is often very difhcun

faction that the silvers have for 
themselves causes them to buncn to 
Xr in certain cells, thus leaving cer- 
& craters empty, and it is because of 
this uneven distribution that a 10 or 15 
diameter enlargement irorn such a nega- 
tive shows a mottled, blotchy, appear- 
ance that is termed to be grainy. 

This is very easily understood, tor m 
each erupted cell there is only one mi- 
croscopic grain of silver, and it tne

grains causes others to leave their cra-

These varied actions make the finished 
photo "blotchy." 



EXPOSURE; 

Over exposed pictures, (that is, films 
that have been over-timed) increase the 
amount of light energy absorbed by the 
silver bromides. This makes developing 
action more rapid, with the result that 
the eruption of the encased silver brO- 
TOMes are greatly accentuated, causing 
the gelatine casings to break down more 
rapidly. This, in turn, allows the silver 
t° become "wild" and then to "clump 
together. 

A. developing chemical with a high re- 
action potential, such as metol, ana 
Quinary developers that are used for 



the ordinary contact plates, reduces sil- 
ver bromides very quickly, Tendering 
them unsatisfactory for fine grain de- 
veloping and they should NOT be used. 

Physical development which produces 
a very even grain consists essentially of 
the reduction of the silvers in the devel- 
oper without the breaking down of the 
gelatine cells and preventing the silvers 
from becoming wild. So in fine grain 
developers, we must use none or very 
little alkali, so as to prevent as far as 
possible the complete collapse of gelatine 
cells; and we must observe the tempera- 
ture of our developer perhaps a little 
more than we do in the usual old time 
developers. 

Warm water, alone, will cause the cells 
to break down rapidly and will cause the 
gelatine not only to collapse, but also to 
swell and cause the film to "frill" or 
check; too much alkali will also caus: 
this. Fine grain developers have a very 
inconvenient point and that is the lengt 1 
of time required to bring about this fin 
grain, even development. The tempera 
ture of the developing solution deter 
mines the length of developing time. Fo 
instance, a fine grain developer used a 
75°, requires 25 minutes developing time 
whereas the same developer, used at 
temperature of 65° requires 30 mmut 
developing time,

TONING PICTURES FOR 
DOUBLE COLOR 

The cost of producing toned, colored 
pictures has been so low that it is now 
done on a commercial basis and is com- 
ing increasingly into demand. Three 
tanks are usually installed, one for Red, 
one for Blue, and one for Green. The 
red is used for toning landscapes, "interi- 
ors, sunsets, fires, etc. The blue is used 
tor ocean, lake, and moonlight scenes. 
The green is for landscapes, flowers* 
trees, and scenery,. The names of the 



colors are placed on the vats to enable 
the employees to sort the pictures out 
quickly when removing the prints from 
the washing tanks. They are simply 
thrown into their respective vats and 
allowed to remain for a space of a couple 
of minutes, then removed and returned 
to the washing vats. After that they 
can be ferro typed in the usual way. 

One of the most important points in 
"toned" color pictures is that the 
"WHITES" of the pictures must not be 
effected or colored by the baths. Exam- 
ple: if a white ship or yacht with white 
sails is photographed, and then toned, 
the white sails and white boat must 
remain white and it is only the reduced 
silvers in the picture that should "take 
on the blue." The finished picture should 
come out with blue water, and white 
boat. Of course, all other black parts 
of the photoprint would take on the 
blue; but that is all right providing the 
other objects that are white remain 
white. 

Same applies to Green. The trees and 
grass would take on the green, but the 
sky would remain white (unless of 
course a sky filter was used on the 
camera). But this is very rare with the 
average amateur camera 'fan; and even 
at that the clouds would be the only 
part of the sky affected. Some very 
beautiful effects have been obtained in 
keeping a cement road white, pho™ 
finishers will find great response to tnis 
class of new printing. The camera ama- 
teur will also find it very interesting t» 
color up his album pictures without Hav- 
ing to have any artists tuition.

chemicals for toning: in a small way, 
can purchase from his local dealer a 
complete set of an assortment of 10 
Lero-toners in a box for a very small 
outlay. 

TWO COLOR PRINTS: 

Photo prints that have been "over 
lapped" with two different colored 
toners, and rendered glossy with a sim- 
le ferrotype plate, produce pleasing ef- 
ects. The advantage of "local color 
oning" is that one does not require any 
ition. Take for instance a photo of a 
church with a tall steeple. One can 
imply take the red toning bath (as pre- 
viously given) and apply it over the 
church with a piece of cotton. There is 
o need to try and keep "within the 
ines" because the toner will not effect 
he "light" parts of the picture. Allow 
he picture to remain on the table (face 
p) for 5 minutes, then rinse in water 
nd immerse the entire print in the 
lue toning bath. After a lapse of five 
inutes the picture is removed from the 
lue toning bath, and washed well in 
unning water for about 15 minutes, 
he finished picture will be a dark red- 
ish brown church with a blue sky. 
his process, perhaps, presents a more 
atural effect that if the photo print was 
olored by an artist. Toned pictures 
hould always be placed on a ferrotype 
late. 

ERROTYPE PLATES OR TINS: 

These tins certainly do produce a gloss 
n photo prints that is impossible to 
btain with the uses of varnishes, etc. 

The plates are very easily made if a 
ood grade of enamel is used (your local 
ardware merchant can supply many 
ationally advertised brands that dry 

ith a high lustre). 

Purchase some sheets of heavy tin, 
•lean well with gasoline and wash in 
oap and warm water, rinse and allow 
o dry.

Take half the turpentine, place th 
broken up bees wax into this, place on 
an electric stove and allow to get hot 
(stirring occasionally). 

Add the remaining part of the tur- 
pentine, and then add the naptha. Bot" 
tie this up, and keep well corked. Care 
should be taken in mixing this solution 
as it is highly inflammable and should 
never be used near an open flame. p 0ur 
a little of this on the painted tin (the 
ferrotype tin) and with a piece of cloth 
spread all over the plate. Wait a few 
minutes until dry and then polish well 
with piece of flannel. The plate is now 
ready to receive prints for glazing. 

The action of this ferrotype or glazing 
tin in producing the gloss on photo 
prints is this: 

When the washed print is drained of 
its surplus water, it is placed on the tin, 
and a piece of blotting paper laid on it. 
A small rubber squeegee roller is then 
run over the back of the print. The 
action of the squeegee roller forces the 
gelatine in the emulsion that is on the 
print, outwards. The forced out gela- 
tine is forced up against the polished 
ferrotype tin, and, that being as far as 
it can go, a layer of shiny gelatine is 
thus formed on the surface of the print 
as it lies face down on the ferrotype 
plate. 

When the photo print is dry, it is 
peeled off the plate and the result is a 
photo print of high lustre. 

Do not forget to polish the ferrotype 
plate with dry clean cloth each time be- 
fore you put prints on it to glaze. 

If the prints are hard to get off, it is 
caused by the emulsion on the prints 
being too* soft. (This can be remedied 
by the addition of a little alum in the 
hypo.) (See Fixation.) 

PANCHROMATIC DESENSITIZ- 
ING DEVELOPERS. (Color gra- 
dation) : 

The introduction in late years of the 
panchromatic plate has found great 
favor in the photographic field. The 
true meaning of the name "Panchroma- 
tic" is "the true rendering of all colors 
in their various gradations." This does 
not mean that a panchromatic plate or 
film in your camera will give you * 
photograph in natural colors. It 
not do this, but it will give you a blacK 
and white reproduction of 'more even 
tone and more illumination in red an 
yellow objects than has been done w«° 
ordinary plates which were insensiwvq 
to red light to a large extent. l a

Highly colored flowers and insects are 
often impossible to photograph with- 
out panchromatic plates or films, as of 
course are paintings and many other 
artificial creations. 

Panchromatic plates and films are 
manufactured by a great number of 
plate manufacturers to overcome this 
trouble of difference in color gradations. 

Now these particular plates or films 
should be developed in total darkness or 
else under the glow of a very faint 
GREEN light. 

This has been one disadvantage that 
the present day camera amateur and 
professional have not been able to get 
acquainted with. 

Chemistry has again come to their as- 
sistance and produced a developer that 
is termed as the panchromatic desensitiz- 
ing developer. 

The PINACRYPTOL family has been 
assembled by the chemists to assist us to 
develop these important plates in a more 
convenient manner. Let us first take 
the mother of all desensitizers, Pinacryp- 
tol GREEN. It is the most efficient 
desensitizer dye that has yet been dis- 
covered, brilliant greenish black crystals, 
soluble in water, giving a non-staining 
solution, which may be made in one to 
500 strength for storage. In addition to 
its non staining qualities it acts more 
efficiently in one in 6000, solution, as a 
desensitizer than phenosafranine, espe- 
cially with panchromatic plates. Its

desensitizer in the developer, is so feeble 
that just as many plates have been 
spoiled by the accidents in darkness as 
those that have been light-struck. 

When you add a desensitizer to your 
developer, you simply place the plate or 
film in the developer under a very feeble 
light. BUT AFTER A LAPSE OF 
TWO MINUTES or even less you can 
then finish the developing under a bright 
red light or even an orange light with 
perfect safety. 

Some developers allow the direct addi- 
tion of the pinacryptol green solution to 
the developer. In this case we recom- 
mend the use of a rodinal developer. 
Also diluted glycine developer permits 
the additoin of the green solution. But 
hydroquinone and all developers contain- 
ing more than 15% grains of hydro- 
quinone in 34 fluid ounces are not 
suitable, for they do not permit the 
addition of the pinacryptol green. 

DESENSITIZER DEVELOPER 
SOLUTIONS: 

To every 3V 2 ounces of the diluted 
developer add 85 drops of the pinacryp- 
tol green 1 in 500 solution. Developing 
should be started in total darkness or 
under a very feeble green light, and 
after 2 minutes the bright red or orange 
light can be turned on and thus the 
development can be finished with ease 
in the light. 

Do not use pinacryptol green on color 
plates, pinacryptol yellow must be used. 
The trouble in altering the brand of 
developer in order to use the pinacryptol 
green can be overcome by the use of 
safranine (1 part in 2.000 parts of 
-water). The chief objection to this de- 
sensitizing agent is that it has been 
giving trouble by staining the plates 
and films. Here is a formula and 
method that will overcome that trouble 
and allow the use of the ordinary devel- 
oper. 

1. Pheno-safraninc 

(water soluble) .... 20 grains 
Water 8 ounces 

2. Formaline (37<% 

solution) ounce 

Sodium sulphate (dry) 1 ounce 
Water to make 9 ounces 

Directions; Add one ounce of (1) solu- 
tion to nine ounces of solution number 
2. The plates or films are bathed in 
this solution for two minutes. They are 
then rinsed and are ready for develop- 
ment. This solution keeps well and 
burdens the film in hot weather. 



Note:— Should you have trouble in a 
stain by the use of safranine in any 
other process this can be removed by 
diazotisation witE" a solution containing 
1 cc. of a 10 per cent solution of 
sodium nitrite, and 1 cc. of a 30 
per cent solution of hydrochloric acid 
per 100 cx.s. 

THE CHEMISTRY OF INTENSI- 
FICATION AND REDUCTION 

REDUCTION: 

The term "reduction" as commonly 
used in photography means the weaken- 
ing of a negative, which because of over- 
exposure or over-development contains 
an image that is too dense. Too much 
silver metal exists in the image, making 
the negative appear flat, foggy and with- 
out contrast in the case of over-ex- 
posure, and too contra sty in the case of 
over-development. 

To adjust such negatives for normal 
and satisfactory printing, some of the 
silver image must be gradually removed 
without injuring the negative. The sil- 
ver metal "of the image, however, resists 
the solvent action of all reagents except 
those which also destroy the gelatin. 
Therefore, it is necessary to first con- 
vert part of the image into some soluble 
silver salt which can be easily washed 
away with water or some other suitable 
solvent. 

This conversion of part of the silver 
image into a soluble silver salt is accom- 
plished with certain oxidizing agents 
which gradually react, forming com- 
pounds such as silver ferro cyanide, sil- 
ver chloride, etc., which are easily dis- 
solved and washed away, leaving only 
the desired amount of silver metal in the 
image. The ease and rate of conversion 
vary with different oxidizing agents. 
Some attack the weaker or shadow parts 
of the silver image first, whereas others 
oxidize the denser parts before reacting 
with the shadow details. This difference 
in action is very desirable since it per- 
mits the choice of a chemical most sa *! s ' 
factory for a particular negative trouble-

INTENSIFICATION PROCESSES: 
Mercury Type and Formulas— Inten- 
sifying with mercury salts imparts dil- 
ferent degrees of increased opacity to 
the image and manufacturers of plates 
and films commonly include formulas 
giving satisfactory results. 

Finely divided mercury metal is more 
opaque than finely divided silver metal. 
It more completely absorbs all wave- 
lengths of light, imparting an intense 
black color by replacing part of all o± 
the sflver metal in the image. 

Most mercury salts are insoluble, but 
mercuric chloride (corrosive subli- 
mate) is sufficiently soluble for use in a 
bath in which the well washed negative 
is placed. (In all except one of the 
following methods, all traces of hypo 
must be eliminated by thorough wash- 
ing to prevent irremovable stains.) lne 
mercuric chloride in solution is broken 
down by the finely divided silver metal 
in the image (which in this form is a 
good reducing agent) to mercurous 
chloride. Simultaneously the silver 
metal is converted (oxidized) into silver 
chloride as follows: 

Silver and mercuric chloride is 
(forming image) 

silver chloride and mercurous chloride 
(forming image) (forming image) 

Thus the original image formed by 
silver metal is changed to a mixture of 
silver chloride and mercurous chloride. 
Both are white insoluble substances so 
that the negative appears free from any 
dark silveT metal when viewed from the 
back by transmitted light. The comple- 
tion of this first step is therefore indi- 
cated by the disappearance of the image. 
Fot this reason the mercuric chloride 
bath is called a "bleach." 

Most formulas recommend adding a 
small quantity of one of the following 
chemicals: sodium chloride, ammonium 
chloride, hydrochloric acid, or potas- 
sium bromide. These substances in the 
order named increase the amount of 
mercuric chloride which may be dis- 
solved in a unit of solution. 

When bleaching is complete the nega- 
tive is -washed in a dilute solution of 
hydrochloric acid to eliminate any ex- 
cess mercuric chloride left in the gela- 
■£\ Washing in water removes most of 
it hut by increasing the solubility, as 
stated above, all of it is removed with 
tne aid of hydrochloric acid, preventing 
future stains. b 



BLACKENING THE BLEACHED 
NEGATIVE: 

After bleaching and washing in the 
dilute hydrochloric acid bath, the nega- 
tive is ready for the final step of break- 
ing down the _ silver chloride and 
mercurous chloride now forming th e 
image. There arc many ways to do this 
but the following represent those most 
commonly used to convert the bleached 
image into mercury metal, silver metal, 
or some complex mercury silver com- 
pound giving an intense black color. 
These solutions are called "blackeners." 
The chemical action of the various kinds 
of blackeners follow: 

SODIUM SULPHITE ANHY- 
DROUS: 

A slight increase in density is obtained 
by placing the negative in a solution of 
sodium sulphite. This is a good blackener 
which converts (reduces chemically) the 
mercurous chloride to finely divided 
mercury metal and possibly a complex 
mercury salt. The silver chloride is 
changed (reduced chemically) to silver 
metal but about half of the silver is 
lost due to solvent action which the 
sodium sulphite exerts, particularly in 
the shadow portions. For negatives 
that are originally too weak in the 
shadows for successful printing, this sol- 
vent action is disastrous, and some other 
blackener should he used. 

The negative is thorougnly wasliea 
after intensifying to eliminate traces oi 
sodium sulphite to stop further action.

PHOTOGRAPHIC FIXATION 

FIXATION: 

Fixing the negative means just what 
it says. It "fixes" the image and pre- 
vents the white parts from blackening 
and destroying the semblance of a pic- 
ture. After the development the unre- 
duced silver salts are removed by the 
action of the fixing bath that is made up 
of a solution of sodium thiosulphate, 
commonly known as hypo. 

No part of the image is affected by 
the hypo unless the prints are foTgotten 
and allowed to remain in the solution too 
long, especially if the prints are floating 
face up. It is best to put prints into 
hypo face down and not leave them in 
the solution longer than twenty minutes. 
Unless the hypo solution is nearly ex- 
hausted, the fixing time should never ex- 
ceed fifteen minutes. 

There are only a few substances that 
will dissolve silver halides and hypo is 
the most used one commercially, because 
of its low cost and its safety in use. 
When emulsions first came into general 
use years ago, potassium cyanide was 
used as the toing salt, but since it is a 
Sangerous poison it is never used today

A Dlain, fresh solution of hypo worts 
Jl in cool weather, but does not remain 
rtVient very long. After a short time 
■£ ^aclfon of the chemicals brought 
^rlrom the developing bath into the 
™ solution stains the prints and nega- 
S that are fixed in it, therefore, some 
Servative must be added to the hypo 
IS bath, which we will discuss shortly. 
As a developing solution agent does 
of act or redSce silver salts except in 
n alkaline condition, and as the purpose 
f the Sg bath must be the opposite, 
t must be acid. This is generally ac- 
4 "pHshed by adding acetic acK Acetic 
Cidf however, turns hypo milky. The 
ypo decomposes into free sulphur and 
solum sulphite- Fortunately, this 
nL em icaI action is reversible, smce a so- 
lution of sulphur and sodium sulphite 
combine to form sodium hyposulphite 
&S am upon boiling. This being the case, 
an excess of sodium sulphite is mam- 
ained in the fixing bath to oppose the 
decomposition of the hypo by the acid. 
In this way it is possible to add sufficient 
acid to the fixing bath to neutralize the 
alkali that is carried from the developer 
on the print or negative into the fixing 
ath and to prevent it from decomposing 
the hypo. 

The excess of the sodium sulphite also 
prevents the oxidation of the developing 
agents that are also carried into the fix- 
ing bath, it acts as a preserver by ab- 
sorbing the oxygen dissolved in the solu- 
tion from the air before it react with the 
developers to form stain. 

All possible sources of trouble in the 
fixing baths are thus far taken care of, 
excepting the softening of the gelatine of 
which the emulsions on prints and nega- 
tives are composed. Some substance has 
therefore to be added to the fixing bath 
in order to take care of this, otherwise, 
negatives would be ruined by frilling 
and peeling off and they would be so soft 
that they would be impossible to handle. 

Potassium chrome alum, therefore, 
enters into the field of trouble-preventing 
and produces such a hardening effect 
on the emulsion that the present day 
fixing bath offers little or no trouble to 
the photographers. Plain potassium 
alum, while not quite such an efficient 
hardener, is often used instead of the 
chrome alum and is especially good for 
prints as it does not give a stain of any 
sort. J 

A worn out fixing bath causes more 
trouble than one cares to entertain, 
bueh as stained prints, fading of prints, 
and a host of other troubles, so there- 



fore, we have prepared a short trouble 
chart on fixation that will enable you to 
look and find what is the cause of your 
troubles. The formulas given in this 
book have been carefully tested, but 
other troubles apart from mixing the 
chemicals may take place according to 
the conditions under which you are 
working. 

STAINING OF PRINTS: 

Insufficient Sulphite. — If this is the 
cause there is no preservative to prevent 
oxygen from the air decomposing the de- 
veloping agent brought over from the 
developing solution. An oxidized devel- 
oper turns the solution brown, staining 
the prints. Too little sulphite will also 
cause the fixing bath to turn milky. 

Insufficient Washing of Negatives 
and Prints. — Washing eliminates most of 
the developer and alkali brought over 
from the developing solution. This 
washing prolongs the life of the fixer hy 
conserving the acid and the sulphite 
which are the enemies of stain. 

Scum on the Surface of the Bath.— 

This contamination attaches itself to the 
surfaces of the emulsions, prevents 
proper fixing, and is generally due to 
impure chemicals, dirt or dust in the 
trays, or it may be due to minerals dis- 
solved in the water making it hard. 

The formation of sludge in hypo baths 
has been a troublesome thing for many 
years, but it has been remedied just a 
few months ago, by the addition of boric 
acid crystals to every gallon of fixer. 
This sludge is a scum of aluminum sul- 
phite and unless removed by careful 
swabbing with absorbent cotton or a 
camel's hair brush it causes trouble, ij 
allowed to dry on the negative once, w 
is practically impossible to remove. 

IF THE BATH DOES NOT 
HARDEN: 

Insufficient Hardener in the Fixer.— 

Not enough alum in the solution or i 
has displaced the sodium in the sulpn"- 
and is, therefore, inactive. The harnei 
ing of gelatin is called tanning and nwj

The simplest thing to remember about 
fixing baths is ONE in FOUR, one ounce 
hypo to four ounces water. 

Adding potassium iodide to the fixing 
bath results in softer and warmer tones. 

Nitrate of silver and salt (y 2 ounce of 
each), salt first and then the silver in- 
tensifies the prints and negatives and 
gives bluish tones. Nitrate of silver and 
potassium iodide (iodide first) gives 
great contrast and warmer tones. 

Alum and acetic acid gives no effect 
on tones, only tends to turn bath a slight 
purplish tone. Sodium chloride increases 
softness. Ammonium chloride increases 
action of hypo 40 per cent. 

SHORT STOPS: 

When negative or print is developed, 
it is washed and transferred to the hypo 
(fixer). But it sometimes happens that 
during the time elapsed between these 
operations development continues to take 
place and the results are that perhaps 
overdevelopment takes place. In betweei 
these two operations (the developing and 
fixing) another bath can be added and 
that is one that is called the 'short 
stop" This bath consists of 32 ounce 
of water in which is added 1 ounce of 
acetic acid, glacial. This short stop bath 
also prevents streaks when prints ar<; 
immersed into the fixing bath.

teur let alone filling the requirements of 
the professional photographer. This ow 
method of fabric printing was unsatis- 
factory from many points of view. ± lrsx 
a lot of trouble was experienced with the 
fixation; if the photo was fixed in plain 
hvpo it meant that about 45 times out 
of 60 the picture would fade out, and it 
it was not fixed, it would blacken all 
over in a few hours. 

By adding a small amount of sulpnite 
to the hypo, it was found that the fixing 
bath performed in a more satisfactory 
manner. However, it did not improve 
the printing qualities. It did not pro- 
duce black and white images and these 
seem to be the ones most desired. The 
old formula was discovered long before 
rayon and crepe de chine fabrics were 
made, and these materials are loaded 
with a metallic salt. 

These metal loads are used by the 
manufacturers to give the cloth weight 
so that the material, when made into 
gowns, will "fall" around the shape of 
the lady for whom it was made. These 
metallic loadings are metal and when 
-they come into contact with silver salts, 
they have the same action as light has 
on the silver, that is, reduction. 

None of the many formulas that have 
been published were ever totally suc- 
cessful until last year, when a sensitizer 
was developed especially for this kind of 
work. It is sold in photographic supply 
stores in bottles ready to use under the 
name of Lerotype Sensitizer. This solu- 
tion will produce pictures in black and 
white tones on all kinds of satins and 
silks without any danger of blackening 
all over and ruining the cloth, This 
process has opened up great possibilities 
in the commercial field for making col- 
ored pictures on satin for radio grills, 
silken banners for theatre advertising, 
cloth covered buttons and inserts for 
dress manufacturers, and many other 
things which call for novel photographic 
effects. Photographers are featuring 
handkerchiefs with the owner's picture 
printed on it and the photo is perma- 
nent and will not wash out. Photo- 
finishers are giving them away as 
premiums with their regular orders. 
The formula is of a very complex na- 
ture, and if you are not a qualified 
chemist, we advise to buy the bottled 
solution from a photo supply house 
rather than attempt to mix it yourself. 

The following is a formula given bv 
the laboratories that manufacture the 
Lerotype sensitizer and it is said to be 
a very satisfactory one: 



^4, Water 32 ounces 

Nitrate of silver .... 8 ounces 

jj. — Potassium bromide . 10 grains 

Water 8 ounces 

Gelatin, pure % ounce 

Use distilled water in this formula 
Soak the gelatine from twenty to thirty 
minutes. Heat "A" to 125° p., then 
add "B" and bring the two combined 
solutions to 125° F. while working under 
a dim red light. Allow the solution to 
remain on the stove for 30 minutes at a 
constant temperature that does not ex- 
ceed 130° F. Higher temperatures spoil 
the mixture and render it worthless. 

After 30 minutes, add the following: 

Water 15 ounces 

Uranium nitrate . . 4 ounces 
Copper chloride . . % ounce 
Potassium iodide . 80 grains 
Pure gelatin % ounce 

Soak this mixture for thirty minutes 
while the first one is on the heat. Upon 
removal of the first solution from the 
heat, add the second one slowly, stirring 
constantly. Filter and pour into en- 
ameled trays set on ice so as to cool 
quickly. 

When cooled, cut up the mixture into 
small pieces, place them in a muslin or 
coarse canvas bag, and twist the bag so 
that the pressure forces the mixture out 
in the form of tiny shreds through the 
meshes of the cloth. Wash these shreds 
in five changes of cool distilled water. 
Now melt the entire mass of shreds 
until it can be poured. Pour into black 
bottles and chill from 40 to 48 hours. 
The sensitizer is then ready for use. 
Caution: Great care must be exercised 
in making this sensitizer to insure that 
no metal comes into contact with the 
solution at any time, otherwise, it will 
be ruined. Glass stirring rods and per- 
fect enamel pots and trays mast be used. 

TRANSFERRING PICTURES ON

This is done by using a transfer paper, 
or a paper with a strong and strippabie 
emulsion. This paper can be made by- 
using the above sensitizer on paper that 
has first been coated with an insoluble

Now we have three coatings on this 
™ner the first one acting merely as a 
Sating for the paper, and the second 
one Sing as an interlocking layer that 
will allow the emulsion or sensitive layer 
to be stripped from the paper. This in- 
terlocking layer will melt when the 
action of heat strikes the back of the 
picture, thus leaving the emulsion that 
carries the picture "free" for the paper 
backing to be stripped from it. (It IS 
not the object of the writer to advertise 
any product mentioned In these pages, 
but for all of those who do not have the 
time and equipment necessary to make 
this paper, it is to he purchased under 
the trade name Lcrotransfer Paper at 
most supply stores.) 

The paper is printed either contact or 
by projection and can he developed with 
any formula given for films and bromide 
papers. It is washed and fixed in 
PLAIN HYPO. The hypo must not 
be acid or contain a hardener. The 
hypo solution is water and hypo, 1 ounce 
hypo to 4 ounces of water. 

Any ordinary negative can be used to 
print and this picture can then be trans- 
ferred from its paper backing to .such 
articles as glass, cigarette cases, ladies' 
compacts, and leather goods, like wallets 
and billfolds ; in f aet, the makers claim 
that it will go on any surface. The 
print is placed on the object and pressed 
flown well so that the emulsion adheres 
to the surface. Then hold the object 
over a heater or stove so that the heat 
strikes the back of the photo. After 
about 15 seconds, the under layer of 
gelatin softens so much that the paper 
ma y be stripped off easily, leaving the 
emulsion on the object used as a new 
? u Pport. After it has thoroughly dried, 
it ean be coated with a waterproof var- 
lush. 



This paper can be used for transfer- 
ring photos to rubber or the new syn- 
thetic rubber, now being used to make 
printing cuts. This synthetic rubber 
line-cut work is becoming widely used 
and the very fact of having the photo 
transferred on the surface eliminates the 
expense of an artist's work. The trans- 
ferred picture on the rubber is black 
and if transferred to this new synthetic 
rubber which is itself black, the pict

cannot be seen by the operator until it 
is reversed from black to white. This 
is very easily accomplished by flowing 
over it a solution of bichloride of mer- 
cury of 1 ounce mixed with 4 ounces of 
water and 10 drops of hydrochloric acid. 

This converts the silvers over into 
mercurous chloride and they appear 
white on the black background of the 
rubber. 

Nothing more is required other than to 
wash the rubber cut in water and allow- 
ing to dry, and the cut is ready for the 
engraver, with the complete picture al- 
ready on it, for him. This transfer work 
is both very interesting and profitable. 
Pictures can be transferred to different 
colored papers and also metallic papers 
and some beautiful effects can be ob- 
tained. 

COLORED PHOTOGRAPHY:

this branch of photography, and already

hght, but so far, colored photography .on

Sea away on the red filter, 8% inches 
on the velhW, and 3*4 inches away from 
the "blue" plate. The exposure takes 
about 11 minutes on F.8 lens wide open. 
(Experiment was on June 22nd, Chicago 
on a bright day.) 

The plates are developed and printed 
on stripping paper and then the yellow 
filter plate is toned with orange toner. 
The red filter is toned red and the blue 
one blue. 

Select a good quality piece of bristol 
board with a fine, smooth finish. Meas- 
ure off the exact position where the 
photo is to be stripped, and in each 
corner place a needle (pierced from the 
back and held firmly in place with seal- 
ing wax). These four needles act as 
the registration guides. 

After blotting off the surplus water 
from the prints, lay each print carefully 
and accurately on top of each other 
being careful that they do not slide. 
Force the three prints on the points of 
the four needles, seeing that they com- 
pletely pierce the three prints. Now, 
take the first print (no particular order 
is necessary, though yellow Is generally 
■first) and slip it carefully over the 
needles Into the registration holes you 
have previously made. When the print 
contacts the paper, run a small squeegee 
roller gently over the print (being care- 
ful not to touch the needle points with 
the roller lest the needles be forced out 
of alignment). 

Hold the cardboard over a small elec- 
tric stove (about G inches above) and 
when you see the edge of the print 
slightly contract, gently strip the paper 
from the emulsion, by tearing or cutting 
with a razor a slit so that the paper 
can he stripped from the print without 
lifting the paper back over the needles 
again, 

j Wait a few minutes until the emulsion 
is set or recovered itself from the heat, 
and then strip the next color in the same 
manner, and then proceed with the third. 
Note:— Many experimenters are get- 
mg beautiful and novel results from the 
use of just two colors such as blue and 
red, yellow and red, and yellow and blue. 

After the pictures have been trans- 
ferred on one another, they can be 
painted with a solution of % ounce of 
formalin in 5 ounces of water. This 
hardens the pictures and they can then 
be varnished with ordinary negative

THE MINIATURE CAMERA 
How to Buy a Camera. — The popu- 
larity of the small camera has been fast 
gaining a great foothold due to the fact 
that it presents the same sales resistance 
as the big automobile does against the 
smaller one. 

The larger automobile necessitates a 
large initial outlay and then followed 
by an expensive upkeep. And the same 
thing applies to the old-fashion large 
camera as against the new miniature 
camera. 

It is true that the miniature camera 
produces only a small picture but it has 
the capabilities of being enlarged many 
many times its original negative size. 

It has however, another important ad- 
vantage, and that is the enormous speed 
that the lens of the miniature camera 
has, for instance it Is possible to "snap" 
any fast moving action with perfect 
sharpness, and can photograph a motor 
car traveling at a terrific speed of 200 
miles per hour and even an airplane 
traveling at a speed of 850 miles per 
hour. 

To purchase a lens with this speed on 
a large camera, the cost would be more 
than $1000. 

We are, therefore, giving you some 
useful information regarding the minia- 
ture camera that will enable you to pro- 
duce enlarged pictures with the same 
amount of sharpness and definition as a 
contact print from a larger camera. 

Serious photographers who but a few 
years ago would have despised pocket- 
able cameras (a 4x5 instrument was at 
one period regarded with disdain) ar e 
now working exclusively with cameras 
giving an original negative smaller than 
a postage stamp. , 

These workers include experienced 
practitioners in commercial, press, « x ~ 
ploration, pictorial and exhibition pic- 
tography, and their amazing and tecn- 
nically perfect photographs have fire 
the general run of "snapshooters," w 
are now realizing the possibilities an 
qualities of the miniature camera » nu J 
are adopting it.
