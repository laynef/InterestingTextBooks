£££ It may be useful to know that 
Sard paper, after spreading, should 
not be long exposed to light and air. By 
S doing not only do* the mustard 
bleach but the rubber soon perishes. 
Moreover, mustard paper is hygroscopic, 
so that in a moist atmosphere it soon 
loses its virtue. It is therefore highly 
important that mustard paper should be 
rapidly dried in a warm atmosphere with 
free ventilation, then at once stored m 
well-closed packets. Thus prepared 
they keep well and remain active for 
many years.

HAIL, INGROWING. 

Copious applications of dried pow- 
dered alum are sufficient to cure every 
case of ingrowing nail in about 5 _ days. 
The applications are not painful m tbe 
least, and the destruction of the patho- 
logic tissue results in the formation ot a 
hard, resistant, and non-sensitive bed 
for the nail, a perfect cure for the in- 
growing tendency. Apply a fomenta- 
tion of soap and water for 24 hours be- 
forehand and then pour the alum into 
the space between the nail and its bed, 
tamponing with cotton to keep the alum 
in place, and repeating the application 
daily. The suppuration rapidly dries 
up, and pain and discomfort are relieved 
almost at once.

Extracting Oil from Cottonseed. — 
Claim is made for a process of extraction, 
in an English patent, in which the seeds 
are placed m a rotable vessel mounted 
on a hollow shaft divided into compart- 
ments by means of a partition. The sol- 
vent is introduced at one end of this 
shaft and passes into the vessel, which is 
then made to rotate. After the extrac- 
tion the bulk of the solvent and the ex- 
tracted oil pass away through an exit 
pipe, and steam is then introduced 
through the same opening as the solvent, 
in order to cook the seeds and expel the 
residual solvent. The steam and_ the 
vapors pass through perforations in a 
scraper fixed to the shaft and thence 
through connected pipes into the other 
compartment of the shaft, the end of 
which is attached to a condenser. 

, Silver Nitrate Test for Cottonseed 
Oil. — Investigations of Charabout and 
March throw some light on the value ot 
this test in presence of olive oil. 
free-fat acids obtained from cottonseed 
oil by saponification were treated in ac- 
cordance with the method of MiHiau. 0 *

of silver nitrate, and the brown precip

Solid Linseed Oil. — Cements for the 
manufacture of linoleum and other sim- 
ilar substances are composed to a large 
extent of linseed oil, oxidized or Poly- 
merized until it has become solid. The 
old process of preparing this solid oil is 
tedious, costly, and invites danger from 
fire. It consists in running linseed oil 
over sheets of thin cloth hung from the 
top of a high building. The thin layer 
of oil upon the cloth dries, and then a 
second layer is obtained in the same way. 
This is continued until a thick skin of 
solid oil is formed on either side of the 
cloth. A new method of solidifying lin- 
seed oil is by means of alkalies^ The 
drying oils, when heated with basic sub- 
stances such as the alkalies, polymerize 
and become solid. Hertkorn makes use 
of the oxides of the alkaline earths, or 
their salts with weak acids, such as their 
soaps. When chalk or lime is added to 
the oil during the process of oxidation, 
either during the liquid or the plastic 
stage, it forms a calcium soap, and causes 
polymerization to set in in the partially 
oxidized oil. Similarly, if caustic soda 
or caustic potash be added, the action is 
not caused by them in the free state, but 
by the soaps which they form. Oxidized 
oil is more readily saponified than raw 
oil, and the greater the oxidation, the 
more readily does saponification take 



iu t UC w earner, 

..... _ „„„ by rain and moisture, 

owing to the soluble soap contained in it, 
while a cement made with lime will not 
be acted upon. It is suggested that the 
action of the bases on linseed oil is simply 
due to their neutralization of the free acia. 
The acidity of_ linseed oil increases as 
it becomes oxidized. When the baric 
matter is added part of the free acid is 
neutralized, and polymerization sets inv 
The presence of a laTge amount of free 
acid must therefore hinder polymeriza- 
tion. From 5 to 10 per cent of chalk or 
lime is considered to be the amount 
which gives the best result in practice. 

Decolorizing or Bleaching Linseed 
Oil. — Linseed oil may be bleached by the 
aid of chemical bodies, the process of 
oxidizing or bleaching being best per- 
formed by means of peroxide of hydro- 
gen. For this purpose, the linseed oil 
to be bleached is mixed with 5 per cent 
peroxide of hydrogen in a tin or glass 
bottle, and the mixture is shaken re- 
peatedly. After a few days have elapsed 
the linseed oil is entirely bleached and 
clarified, so that it can be poured off 
from the peroxide of hydrogen, which 
has been reduced to oxide of hydrogen, 
i. e., water, by the process of oxidation. 
The use of another oxidizing medium, 
such as chloride of lime and hydro, 
chloric acid or bichromate of calcium 
and sulphuric acid, etc., cannot be rec- 
ommenced to the layman ¥ *he opg- 
ation requires more care and is not with- 
out danger. If there is no hurry about 
?hc preparation of bleached linseed oil 
sun bleaching seems to b . the most 
recommendab e method. For this oniv 
a class bottle is required, or, heUer^tm,

Decolorizing and Deodorizing Oils 

I. — One may partially or completely 
deodorize and decolorize rank fish and 
other oils by sending a current of hot air 
or of steam through them, after having 
heated them from 175° to 200° F. To 
decolorize palm oil pass through it a 
current of steam under pressure corre- 
sponding to a temperature of 230° p., 
agitating the oil constantly. The vapor 
is then passed through leaden tuyeres of 
about 2 inches diameter, 10 hours being 
sufficient for deodorizing 4 tons of oil. 

II. — Another method that may he ap- 
plied to almost all kinds of fats and oils 
with excellent results is the following: 
Melt say 112 parts, by weight, of palm 
oil in a boiler. When the mass is en- 
tirely liquefied add to it a solution of cal- 
cium chloride, made by dissolving 7 
parts, by weight, of lime chloride for 
every 84 parts, by weight, of oil in water, 
and mix intimately. After cooling, the 
mass hardens and is cut into small bits 
and exposed to the air for a few weeks, 
iifter this exposure the material is re- 
assembled in a boiler of iron, jacketed 
on the inside with lead; a quantity of sul- 
phuric acid diluted to 5 per cent, equal in 
amount to the lime chloride previously 
used, is added, and heat is applied until 
the oil melts and separates from the 
other substances. It is then left to cool 
off and solidify. 

Decomposition of Oils, Fats, etc. — 
In many of the processes at present in 
use, whereby oils and fats are decom- 
posed by steam at a high pressure, the 
time during which the oil or fat has to 
be exposed to high pressure and tem- 
perature has the effect of considerably 
darkening the resulting product. Han- 
nig's^ process claims to shorten the time 
required, by bringing the steam and ml 
into more intimate contact. The oil to 
be treated is projected in fine streams 
into the chamber containing steam at 8 
to 10 atmospheres pressure. The streams 
of oil are projected with sufficient force 
to cause them to strike against the walls 
of the chamber, and they are thus broken 
up into minute globules which mix inti- 
mately with the steam. In this way tne 
most satisfactory conditions for the de- 
composition of the oil are obtained.

Ir.tJnfr? etc., the most economical 
SffiEto bol them with shot to leave 
them for some time m contact with 
hot or else to boil them with lith- 
arge Another method consists in boil- 
in^ the oils with equal parts of lead, tin, 
and sulphate of zinc in the ratio of to 
nart (weight) of the united inelals to 1 
Dart of oil to be treated. These metuls 
must be granulated, which is easily ac- 
complished by melting them separately 
and putting them in cold water. Ihey 
will be found at the bottom of the water 
in the shape of small balls. It is m this 
manner, by the way, that shot is pro- 
duced. 

Dust-Laying Oil. — A process has been 
patented for rendering mineral oils mis- 
cible in all proportions of water. The 
method consists of forming an intimate 
mixture of the oil with a soap which is 
soluble in water. The most simple 
method is as follows: The oil is placed 
in a tank provided with an agitator. The 
latter is set in motion and the fatty oil or 
free fatty acid from which the soap is to 
be formed is added, and mixed inti- 
mately with the mineral oil. When the 
mixture is seen to be thoroughly homo- 
geneous, the alkali, in solution in water, 
is added little by little and the stirring 
continued until a thorough emulsion is 
obtained, of which the constituents do 
not separate, even after prolonged stand- 
ing at ordinary temperatures. The 
agitation may be produced either by a, 
mechanical apparatus or by forcing air 
in under pressure. As a rule, the oper- 
ation can be carried out in the cold, but 
in certain cases the solution of the fatty 
body and its saponification requires 
the application of moderate heat. This 
faay be obtained by using either a steam- 
jacketed pan, or by having the steam 
coil within the pan, or live steam may 
he blown through the mixture, serving at 
the same time both as a heating and 
stirring agent. Any fatty matter or 
fatty acid suitable for soap-making may 
be used, and the base may be any one 
capable of forming a soluble soap, most 
commonly the alkaline hydroxides, 
caustic soda, and caustic potash, as also 



ammonia. Th< 



-Je raw materials are chos- 
en according to the use to which the fin- 
ished product is to be applied. A good 
formula suitable for preparing an oily 
liquid for watering dusty roads, is as

The soap is dissolved in the water 
heated for that purpose, the wax mixed 
in with much stirring, and, when all is in 
solution, the ammonia is added. When 
clear, the lanolin is put in, and then, if 
the mixture is very thick, water is added 
until the whole has the consistency of 
honey. Keep in a covered stoneware 
jar. The hands should be first washed 
with ordinary soap, and then, while the 
lather is still on them, a hit of the mixture 
about the size of a hazel nut is rubbed in 
until all is absorbed, and the hands are 
dry. At the close of the work, the film 
of wax is washed off in warm water and 
a little lpnolin rubbed into the hands.

PAINTING PROCESSES ; 

Painting Ornaments or Letters on 
Cloth and Paper. — Dissolve gum shellac 
in 95 per cent alcohol at the rate of 1 
pound of shellac to 3 pints of alcohol, and 
mix with it any dry color desired. If 
it becomes too thick, thin with more 
alcohol. This works free, does not 
bleed out, imparts brilliancy to the color, 
and wears well. The preparation can 
be used also on paper. 

Painting on Marble.— To paint marble 
in water colors, it must be first thor- 
oughly cleaned and all grease com- 
pletely removed. The slab is washed 
well, and then rubbed off with benzine 
by means of a rag or sponge. In order 
to be quite sure, add a little ox gall or 
aguolme to the colors. After rnarEle has

PAINTINGS : 

Protection for Oil Paintings. — Oil 
paintings should under no circumstances 
be varnished over before the colors are 
surely and unmistakably dry, otherwise 
the Assuring and early decay of the sur- 
face may be anticipated. The conten- 
tion of some people that oil paintings 
need the protection of a coat of varnish 
is based upon the claim that the picture, 
unvarnished, looks dead and lusterless 
in parts and glossy in still others, the 
value and real beauty of the color being 
thus unequally manifested. It is not to 
be inferred, however, that a heavy coat- 
ing of varnish is required. When it is 
deemed advisable to varnish over an oil 
painting the varnish should be mastic, 
with perhaps 3 or 4 drops of refined lin- 
seed oil added to insure against cracking. 
A heavy body of varnish used oyer 
paintings must be strictly prohibited, in- 
asmuch as the varnish, as it grows in 
age, naturally darkens in color, and in so 
doing carries with it a decided clouding 
and discoloration of the delicate pig- 
ments, A thinly applied coat of mastic 
varnish affords the required protection 
from all sorts and conditions of atmos- 
pheric impurities, besides fulfilling its 
mission in other directions. 

Oil paintings, aquarelles, etc., may 
also coated with a thin layer of Canada 
balsam, and placed smoothly on a pane 
of glass likewise coated with Canada 
balsam, so that both layers of balsam 
come together. Then the pictures are 
pressed down from the back, to rem^ e 
all air bubbles. 

To Renovate Old Oil Paintings.— 
When old oil paintings have becom. 
dark and cracked, proceed as f° n °Y' 
Pour alcohol in a dish and put the p«- 
ture over it, face downward. The fiim* 
of the alcohol dissolve the paint of

Dark-Green Paint for Blackboards. — 

Mix 1 part Prussian blue and 1 part 
chrome green with equal parts of 
gilders' size and alcohol to a thin cream 
consistency. Apply with a large, stiff 
brush and after an hour a second coat is 
given. After 24 to 48 hours smooth the 
surface with a felt cloth. This renders 
it rich and velvety. The shade must be 
a deep black green and the quantities of 
the colors have to be modified accordingly 
if necessary. Old blackboards should 
be previously thoroughly cleaned with 
soda. 

BRONZING SOLUTIONS FOR PAINTS. 

I The so-called " banana solution" 

(the name being derived from its odor) 
which is used in applying bronzes of 
various kinds, is usually a mixture of 
equal parts of amyl acetate, acetone,

not let the string touch the soap. 

Paint brushes which have dried up as 
hard as stone can be cleaned m the fol- 
lowing manner: Dissolve 1 part soda 
in 3 parts water; pour the solution in a 
cylinder glass, and suspend in it the 
brushes to be cleaned, so that they are 
about 2 inches from the bottom of the 
vessel. Let it remain undisturbed at a 
temperature of 140° to 158° F., IS to 24 
hours, after which the most indurated 
brushes will have become soft, so that 
they can be readily cleaned with soap. 
It is essential, however, to observe the 
temperature, as bristle brushes will be 
injured and spoiled if the heat is greater. 

Black. — A Permanent Black of Rich 
Luster for Metal Boxes. — Dissolve 
chlorate of potassium and blue vitriol, 
equal parts, in 38 times as much water, 
and allow the solution to cool. The 
parts to be blacked may be either dipped 
in the solution, or the solution may be 
flowed on and allowed to remain until 
the metal becomes black, after which the 
fixtures should be rinsed in clean water 
and allowed to dry. Those parts of the

To Prevent Crawling of Paints.— 
Probably the best method to pursue 
will be to take an ordinary flannel rag 
and carefully rub it oyer the work pre- 
vious to varnishing, striping, or painting. 
This simple operation will obviate the 
possibility of crawling. 

In some instances, however, crawling 
may be traced to a defective varnish. 
The latter, after drying evenly on a well- 
prepared paint surface will at times 
crawl, leaving small pitmarks. For this, 
the simple remedy consists in purchasing 
varnish from a reputable manufacturer. 

FIREPROOF PAINTS: 

See also Fircproofing. 

Fireproofing paints of effective quality 
are prepared in different ways. Natu- 
rally no oily or greasy substances enter 
into their composition, the blending agent 
being simply water. 

I. — One of the standing paint3 con- 
sists of 40 pounds of powdered asbestos, 
10 pounds of alummate of soda, 10 
pounds of lime, and 30 pounds of silinate 
of soda, with the addition of any non- 
rosinous coloring matter desired. The 
whole is thoroughly mixed with enough 
water to produce a perfect blend and 
render an easy application. Two _ or 
niorc coats of this is the rule in applying 
it to any wood surface, inside or outside 
of building. 

II. — Another formula involves the use 
of 40 pounds of finely ground glass, a 
like amount of ground porcelain, and 
similarly of China clay or the same quan- 
tity of powdered asbestos, and 20 pounds 
of quicklime. These materials are 
ground very fine and then mixed in W 
pounds of liquid silicate of soda witn 
water, as in the preceding formula. U wo 
or more coats, if necessary, are given 

Each of these paints is applied with a 
brush in the ordinarv way, the drying 
being accomplished in a few hours, and, 
if coloring matter is desired, the abo^e 
proportions are varied accordingly- 

III. — A surface coated with 3 coats W 
water glass, these 3 coats being sut

to meet any desired shade and itmay be

Et most of the pretentiously sounded 
pigments on the markets are. 

Fireproof and Waterproof Paints.— 
The following recipes are claimed to 
resist both fire and water: A prepara- 
tion for protecting wood against the ac- 
tion of fire and of moisture, and also ior 
producing on the surface of wood and 
metal a coat, insulating with reference to 
electricitv and preservative from corro- 
sion, has been introduced m France 
by Louis Bethisy and Myrthil Rose. 
The bases or fundamental raw materials 
quite distinct from those hitherto em- 
ployed for the same purpose, are 100 
parts, by weight, of nitro-cellulose and 30 
parts, by weight, of chloride of lime, dis- 
solved in 50 per cent alcohol. 

Preparation of the Bases. — The cellu- 
lose (of wood, paper, cotton, linen, ramie, 
or hemp) is put in contact with^two- 
thirds part of sulphuric acid of 66°^ Be. 
and one-third part of nitric acid of 42° Be. 
for some 20 or 30 minutes, washed with 
plenty of water, and kept for 24 hours in 
a tank of water supplied with an ener- 
getic current. , . 

The nitro-cellulose thus obtained is 
bleached for this purpose; a double hypo- 
chlorite of aluminum and magnesium is 
employed. This is obtained by grinding 
together 100 parts of chloride of lime, 60 
parts of aluminum sulphate, 23 parts of 
magnesium sulphate, with 200 parts of 
water, 

"When the nitro-cellulose is bleached 
and rewashed, it is reduced to ^ powder 
and dried as thoroughly as possible. It 
is then placed in a vat hermetically closed 
and put in contact with the indicated 
proportion of calcium chloride dissolved 
m alcohol. This solution of calcium 
chloride should be prepared at least 
24 hours in advance and filtered. 

Composition, of the Coating. — This 



has the following constituents: Bases 
(nitro-cellulose and solution of calcium 
chloride), 1 part; amyl acetate (solvent 
of the bases), 5 parts, by weight; sul- 
phuric ether of 65°, 1.650 parts, by 
weight; alcohol, 0.850 parts, by weight; 
one of these powders, alum, talc, as- 
bestos, or mica, 0.100 parts. Other sol- 
vents may be employed instead of amyl 
acetate; for example, acetone, acetic acid, 
ether alcohol, or methylic alcohol. The 
ether alcohol furnishes a product drying 
very quickly. If a very pliant coating 
is desired, the amyl acetate is employed 
preferably, with addition of vaseline oil, 
0.20 parts, and lavender oil, 0.010 parts. 

Method of Operating. — The sulphuric 
acid is mixed with the alcohol, and left 
for an hour in contact, shaking from 
time to time. Afterwards the amyl ace- 
tate is added, and left in contact for an- 
other hour under similar agitation. I_ 
case of the employment of vaseline o' 
and lavender on, these two are mingle 
in ether alcohol. The base is introduce 
and left in contact for 24 hours, wit 
frequent agitation. The fluidity of th 
product is augmented by increasing th 
quantity of the solvent. 

Properties. — Wood covered with thi 
coating is fireproof, non-hygrometri 
and refractory to the electric current. I 
also resists the action of acids and alk" 
lies. Metals covered with it are she! 
tered from oxidation, and effeetuall 
insulated on their surface from the ete 
trie current. The coating is liquid i 
form, and applied like collodions, eith 
by the brush or by immersion or otn 
suitable method.

PAINTS FOR GOLD AND GILDING: 

Goli Paints.— The formulas of the 
various gold paints on the market are 
arefully guarded trade secrets. Essen- 
tially they consist of a bronze powder 
mixed with a varnish. The best bronze 
iowder for the purpose is what is known 
n the trade as "French flake," a deep 
raid bronze. This bronze, as seen under 
the microscope, consists of tiny flakes or 
spangles of the bronze metal. As each 
minute Bake forms a facet for the re- 
flection of color, the paint made with it 
is much more brilliant than that, prepared 
from finely powdered bronze. F

From 1 to 4 ounces of flake bronze is to 
be mixed with this ^quantity of varnish 
For silver paint or "aluminum enamel'' 
flake aluminum bronze powder should 
be used in place of the gold. The cellu 
loid varnish incloses the bronze particles 
in an impervious coating, air-tight and 
water-tight. As it contains nothing that 
will act upon the bronze, the latter re- 
tains its luster for a long period, until 
the varnished surface becomes worn or 
abraded and the bronze thus exposed to 
atmospheric action. 

All of _ the "gold" or, more properly, 
gilt furniture that is sold so cheaply by" 
the furniture and department stores is 
gilded with a paint of this kind, and for 
that reason such furniture can be offered 
at a moderate price. The finish is sur- 
prisingly durable, and in color and luster 
is a very close imitation of real gold-leaf 
work. This paint is also used on picture 
frames of cheap and medium grades, tak- 
ing the place of gold leaf or the lacquered 
silver leaf formerly used on articles of the 
better grades; it is also substituted for 
"Dutch metal," or imitation gold leaf, on 
the cheapest class of work. 

A cheaper gold paint is made by using 
an inexpensive varnish composed ol 
gutta percha, gum darn mar, or some 
other varnish gum, dissolved in benzole, 
or in a mixture of benzole and benzine. 
The paints made with a celluloid-amyJ- 
acetate varnish give off a strong banana- 
like odor when applied, and may be read- 
ily recognized by this characteristic. 

The iin palpably powdered bronzes 
are called "lining" bronzes. They are 
chiefly used for striping or lining by car- 
riage painters; in bronzing gas fixtures 
and metal work; in fresco and other in- 
terior decoration, and in printing; the 
use of a very fine powder in inks or paints 
admits of the drawing or printing of very 
delicate lines. 

■Lining bronze is also used on picture 
frames or other plastic ornamental work. 
Mixed with a thin weak glue sizing it is 
applied over "burnishing clay," a nd 
when dry is polished with agate bur- 
nishers. The object thus treated, after 
receiving a finishing coat of a thin trans- 
parent varnish, imitates very closely m 
appearance a piece of finely cast antique 
bronze. To add still more to this ettect 
the burnishing clay is colored the g ree °" 
ish black that is seen in the deep P aTl * 
of real antique bronzes, and the bronjj 
powder, mixed with size, is applied ojUJ 
to the most prominent parts or ^ 
lights" of the ornament.

bough! ready made, barf g the White of 
Sg g additioial. The best and most 
Stable, and especially suited for fine 
work is undoubtedly the red French 
gold 'size. It is cleaned, as far as pos- 
sible of all impurities, and powdered. 
For 246 grains lake 1 white of egg; put it 
into a glass, taking care to exclude the 
volk entirely— otherwise the burnish will 
show black spots. Beat the white of egg 
to a froth with a long, well-cleaned bristle 
brush; add the froth to the size and grind 
finely together, which is soon done. 
When grinding, a little water and red 
size, if necessary, may be added (use 
only water for thinning). After being 
ground, the size is forced through a very 
fine hair sieve into a perfectly clean 
vessel, and covered up well, for imme- 
diate or subsequent use. 

The raw stuff of the red size is bolus, 
which is dug in France and Armenia in 
excellent quality. Besides the red size 
there are yellow, white (pipe clay), blue, 
and gray (alumina), which are used for 
certain "purposes, to enumerate which 
here would lead too far. 

For burnish gold, always take yellow 
size for ground work. Dip a finely 
ground bristle brush in the gold size pre- 
pared for use; fill a well-cleaned glass 
(holding 1 pint) half full of water, and 
add the size contained in the brush, also 
about 4 to 5 spoonfuls of pure alcohol. 
It is advisable not to take too much size; 
the liquid, when applied, must hardly 
have a yellow tint. When this is dry 
soon after, commence applying the size, 
for which a hair pencil is used. The 
essentials are to paint evenly and not too 
thickly, so that the tone remains uniform. 
^■PPly three coats of size. 

When the size is laid on correctly and 
has become dry, brush the whole with 
a special brush, or rub with a flannel rag, 
so as to obtain the highest possible luster. 
-The size must not stand too long; other- 
wise no gloss can be developed. After 
brushing, coat the work with weak glue 
yjater and wrap it up in tissue paper if 
kegilding is not to be done at once. 
The strictest cleanliness is essential, as 



the red gold size is very sensitive. The 
parts where the size has been applied 
must not be touched with the hand, else 
grease spots will ensue, which will make 
a flawless gloss in gilding impossible. 
Ihe least relaxation of the necessary 
attention may spoil the whole job, so that 
everything has to be ground off again. 

The necessary tools for the application 
of gold leaf are: Hair pencils of various 
sizes, tip, cushion, and gilding knife, as 
with oihgilding. Take pure alcohol or 
grain brandy, and dilute with two-thirda 
water. When ready to apply the gold 
leaf, dip a hair pencil of suitable size into 
the fluid, but do not have it full enough 
that the alcohol will run on the size 
ground. Moisten a portion of the 
ground surface as large as the gold leaf, 
which is laid on immediately after. 
Proceed in the same manner, first mois- 
tening, then applying the ready-cut gold 
leaf. The latter must not be pressed on, 
but merely laid down lightly, one leaf a 
little over the edge of the previous one, 
without using up too much gold. Tech- 
nical practice in gold-leaf gilding is 
presupposed; through this alone can any 
skill be acquired, reading being of no 
avail. 

The leaf of gold being applied, all dus 
must be swept off by means of a light, 
fine hair pencil (but never against th 
overlapping edges), and the burnishuv 
is commenced. For this purpose ther 
are special agate tools of the shape of 
horn. Flint stone, blood stone, an 
wolf's teeth are sometimes, but gradua 1 
more seldom, employed. Burnish till 
full, fine luster appears; but very car 
fully avoid dents and lines, not to spea 
of scratches, which would be very har 
to mend.

LUMINOUS PAINTS. 

The illuminating power of the phos- 
phorescent masses obtained by heating 
strontium thiosulphate or barium thio- 
sulphate is considerably increased by the 
addition, before heating, of small quan- 
tities of the nitrates of uranium, bismuth, 
or thorium. Added to calcium thio- 
sulphate, these nitrates do not heighten 
the luminosity or phosphorescence. 
The product from strontium thiosul- 
phate is more luminous than that of the 
barium compound. Among the best 
luminous paints are the following: 

I. — Tennord's. — One hundred parts, 
by weight, of strontium carbonate; 100 
parts, by weight, of sulphur; 0.5 parts, 
by weight, of potassium chloride; 0.S 
parts, by weight, of sodium chlorides 
0-4 parts, by weight, of manganese 
chloride. The materials are heated tor 
three-quarters of an hour to one hour, 
to about 2,372° F. The product gives 
a violet light. 

II. — Mourel's.— One hundred parts, by 
weight, of strontium carbonate; 30 parts, 
by weight, of sulphur; 2 parts, by weight, 
of sodium carbonate; 0.5 parts, by weigju

PAINTS FOR METAL SURFACES: 

Blackening Ornaments of Iron.— I — 
To five irnn ornaments a black- brown 
to black color, proceed in the following 
manueL- The articles are treated with 
corrosives, cleaned of all adhering grease, 
and placed in a 10 per cent solution ot 
potassium bichromate, dried in the air, 
and finally held over an open, well-glow- 
ing, non-sooting fire for 3 minutes. 1 he 
first coloring is usually black brown, but 
if this process is repeated several times, 
a pure black shade is obtained. Special 
attention has to be paid to removing all 
grease, otherwise the greasy spots will 
not be touched by the liquid^ and the 
coloring produced will become irregular. 
Benzine is employed for that P U JP°. S ^ 
and the articles must not be touched with 
the fingers afterwards. 

II. — This process protects the iron 
from rust for a long time. The treat- 
ment consists in coating the objects very 
uniformly with a thin layer of hnseed-ou 
varnish, and burning it off over a char- 
coal fire. During the deflagration the 
draught must be stopped. The varnish 
will first go up in smoke with a strong 
formation of soot, and finally burn up 
entirely. The process is repeated, i. e., 
after one coating is burned off a new one 
is applied, until the parts exhibit a uni- 
formly handsome, deep • black color. 
■Next, wipe off the covering with a dry 
and heat again, but only moder- 



ately. Finally, the articles are taken 
from the fire and rubbed with a rag well 
saturated with linseed-oil varnish. The 
black turns completely dull, and forms a 
real durable covering for the objects. 

Black for Polished Iron Pieces. — Apply 

successive layers of a very concentrated 
solution of nitrate of manganese dis- 
solved in alcohol over a gentle fire and 
the water bath. The surfaces to be 
blackened should be previously heated. 
By repeating the layers all the lints be- 
tween brownish black and bluish black 
may be obtained. 

Glossy Black for Bicycles, etc. — 

Amber 8 ounces 

Linseed oil 4 ounces 

Asphaltum 1% ounces 

Rosin l| ounces 

Oil turpentine 8 ounces 

Heat the linseed oil to boiling point, 
add the amber, asphaltum, and rosin, 
and when all melted remove from the fire 
and gradually add the turpentine 



Japan Black.— The following is 
good japan black for metal surfaces: 
Take IS ounces of amber and 2 ounces 
of asphaltum. Fuse by heat, and add

• th or dinary precautions can be more 
readily painted with the prospect of a 
Eminent adhesion of the paint, than a 
permanent a ght , iron surface. 

fhetttrTt has hlea demonstrated 
that a hard and elastic paint* needed 
•hilf with regard to cast iron, otner 
paints lontainfng iron oxides are more 
suitable. For good drying and cov ennj 
properties, as well as elasticity a good 
Eoiled oil to which has been added an 
adequate proportion of red lead will be 
found to form an excellent paint for 
°mooth metal surfaces. The primary 
object is to protect the surface of the iron 
from moisture for the purpose of avoid- 
ing rust. The priming must therefore 
be carried out so that it will stick after 
which subsequent coats may be added it 
desired. 

It is advisable that articles made of 
iron should first be coated with lmseed- 
oil varnish. It dries slowly, hardens, 
and enables the operator afterwards to 
exercise an effective control over the con- 
dition of his material. Iron must be 
absolutely dry and free from rust when 
it is to be painted. It is best to apply 
next a coating of hot linseed oil; when 
dry this should be followed by a priming 
of pure red lead in good linseed oil, ana 
the iron should then be painted as de- 
sired, using ground oil paints and leav- 
ing an interval of a week between each 
coating. Cementing should be done 
after the red lead priming, but the last 
coat must not be given until the whole is 
thoroughly dry. Bright oil paints and 
an upper coating with plenty of oil resist 
the effects of heat better than thin coat- 
ings; moreover, rust can be detected in 
its early stages with the former. Coat- 
ings of tar and asphalt (asphalt dissolved 
m turpentine) are practicable for under- 
ground p lpes but are not adapted for 
pipes exposed to the air, as they are 
quickly spoiled. Asphalt varnish/used

in gltss or stoneware, as tin will prec'ir/ 
tate the copper salts and make the solu"

solution is applied with a broad brush 
when the surface assumes a deep bl ac k 
color, which in drying out in from 12 to 
24 hours becomes a gray white, Upori 
which the properly prepared primer will 
take a permanent grip. On the film so 
produced a much thinner paint will 
cover very much better than a stouter 
paint would on the untreated galvanized 
or ordinary iron surface. A single trial 
will convince the craftsman that this 
treatment is a method that will gi ve 
lasting results, provided he tries the same 
priming paint on the treated and un- 
treated surface. 

To Paint Wrought Iron with Graphite. 
— In order to make wrought iron look 
like new mix fine graphite with equal 
parts of varnish and turpentine oil, add- 
ing a little siccative. Paint the iron 
parts with this twice, allowing to dry 
each time. Especially the second coat- 
ing must be perfectly dry before further 
treatment. The latter consists in pre- 
paring graphite with spirit and applying 
it very thinly over the first coat. After 
the drying or evaporation of the spirit 
the graphite last applied is brushed 
vigorously, whereby a handsome, dura- 
ble gloss is produced. 

Paint for Iron Bodies Exposed to 
Heat. — Dilute 1 part soda water glass 
with 2 parts water and mix intimately 
with the following pigments: 

White. — White lead or sulphate of 
barium. 

Yellow. — Chromate of barium, ocher, 
or uranium yellow. 

Green. — Chromic oxide or ultramarine 
green. 

Blue. — Ultramarine. 

Brown. — Oxide of cadmium, oxide of 
manganese or terra di sienna. 

Red. — English red or chronic red. 

Bronze powder in a suitable quantity 
may be added to the mixture, but not 
niore paint should be prepared than can 
be used up in a few bour<i. The bronje 
powder may also be strewn on the tr csu 
paint, or applied with a dry brush, w

Xed by the following process: Mix 
? °0 parts dry iron sulphate and 8J parts 
Sum chlorate and heat to 1,500 to 
vR00» F The chlorine set free seems 
to have a very favorable action on the 
iobr of the simultaneously forming iron 
Zcide In order to avoid, however, too 
far-reaching an effect of the chlorine gas 
about 18 pounds of a substance which 
absorbs the same mechanically, such as 
kaolin, ground pumice stone, ocner, 
etc., are added to the mixture. 

II— A material known under the 
names of lardite, steatite, agalmatolite, 
pa<Wite, is excellently adapted as a sub- 
stitute for the ordinary metallic protec- 
tive agent of the pigments and has the 
property of protecting iron from rust m 
an effective manner. In China, lardite 
is used for protecting edifices of sand- 
stone, which crumbles under the action 
of the atmosphere. Likewise a thin 
layer of powdered steatite, applied in the 
form of paint, has been found valuable 
there as a protector against the decay of 
obelisks, statues, etc. Lardite, besides, 
possesses the quality of being exceedingly 
fine-grained, which renders this material 
valuable for use in ship painting. 
Ground steatite is one of the finest ma- 
terials which can be produced, and no 
other so quickly and firmly adheres to the 
fibers of iron and steel. Furthermore, 
steatite is lighter than metallic covering 
agents, and covers, mixed in paint, a 
larger surface than zinc white, red lead, 
or iron oxide. Steatite as it occurs in 
Switzerland is used there and in the 
Tyrol for stoves, since it is fireproof. 

_ Steel. — An excellent coating for steel, 
imitating the blue color of natural steel, 
is composed of white shellac, 5 parts; 
borax, 1 part; alcohol, 5 parts; water, 4 
parts; and a sufficient quantity of methy- 
lene blue. The borax is dissolved in 
^ater, the shellac in alcohol. The 
aqueous solution of the borax is heated 
tea boil and the alcoholic solution of the 
shellac is added with constant stirring. 
Next add the blue color, continuing to 
3tir. Before this coating is applied to 
me steel, e. g., the spokes of a bicycle, 
the latter are first rubbed off with fine 
emery paper. The coat is put on with 



a soft rag. The quantity of pigment tc 
be added is very small. By varying the 
quantity a paler or darker coloring of the 
steel can be produced. 

PA INTS FOR ROOFS AND ROOF 

Carbolineum.— This German prepar- 
ation is made in three colors. 

I. — Pale.— Melt together in an iron 
kettle, over a naked fire, 30 parts of 
American rosin F and 150 parts of pale 
paraffine oil and stir in 10 parts of single 
rectified rosin oil. 

II. — Dark.— Melt 100 parts of an- 
thracene oil and 20 parts of American 
rosin F on a slow fire. Next stir in 2 
parts of Para rubber solution {or solution 
of caoutchouc waste) and keep on boil- 
ing until all is dissolved. When this is 
done there should be still added 5 parts 
of crude concentrated carbolic acid and 
5 parts of zinc chloride lye, 50° Be., stir- 
ring until cool. The last- named ad- 
mixture is not absolutely necessary, but 
highly advisable, owing to its extraor- 
dinary preservative and bactericidal 
properties. 

HI. — Colored— For red, melt 100 
parts of coal-tar oil, then stir in 50 parts 
of pale paraffine oil, and finally 75 parts 
of bole or iron minium, and pass through 
the paint mill. Although the addition of 
iron minium is very desirable, it is con- 
siderably more expensive. For gray, 
proceed as above, with the exception 
that metallic gray is used m place of tne 
bole. For green, metallic green is em- 
ployed. The colors are identical with 
those used in the manufacture of roof 
varnish. To increase the antiseptic 
properties of the, colored carbolineum 
any desired additions of phenol or mm 
chloride solutions may be made but the 
chief requirement in the case ^of colored 
carbolineum is good covering power ot

SuriS several days before painting. 
Ks will change the surplus caustic lime 
to sulphate of lime or gypsum The 
acid should be about one-half chamber 
ac d and one-half water. This should be 
repeated before painting, and a coat of 
raw linseed oil flowed on freely should 
be given for the first coat While this 
cannot be always guaranteed as effectual 
for making the pamt hold, it is the best 
method our correspondent has heard ot 
for the purpose, and is worth trying when 
H is absolutely necessary to pamt over 
fresh cement. 

Damp Walls, Coating for.— Thirty 
parts of tin are dissolved m 40 parts of 
hydrochloric acid, rnd 30 parts of sal 
ammoniac are added. A powder com- 
posed of freestone, 50 parts; zine oxide, 
20 parts; pounded glass, 15 parts; pow- 
dered marble, 10 parts; and calcined 
magnesia, 5 parts, is prepared, and made 
into a paste with the liquid above men- 
tioned. Coloring matter may be added. 
The composition may be used as a 
damp-proof coating for walls, or for 
repairing stonework, or for molding 
statues or ornaments. 

Facade Paint. — For this zinc oxide is 
especially adapted, prepared with size 
or casein. Any desired earth colors may 
also be added. The surfaces are coated 
8 times with this mass. After the third 
application is dry, put on a single coat- 
ing of zinc chloride solution of 30° Be. 
to which 3 per cent borax is added. 

This coating is very solid, can be 
washed, and is not injured by hydrogen 
sulphide. 

Hard -Finished Walls.— The treatment 
for hard-finished walls which are to be 
painted in flat colors is to prime with a 
thin coat of lead and oil well brushed 
into the wall. Next put on a thin coat of 
size; next a coat mixed with 4 oil 



paint dries too fast, and is liable to show 
laps, put a little glycerine in, to retard 
the drying. 

PAINTS, WATERPROOF AND 
WEATHERPROOF: 

See also Fireproof Paint. 
The following are claimed to be both 
waterproof and weatherproof: 

I. — In 50 parts, by weight, of spirit 
of 96 per cent, dissolve 16 part3, by 
weight, of shellac, orange, finely pow- 
dered; 3 parts, by weight, of silver lake, 
finely powdered; and 0.6 parts, by 
weight, of gamboge, finely powdered. 
This paint may be employed without ad- 
mixture of any siccative, and is excel- 
lently adapted for painting objects which 
arc exposed to the inclemencies of the 
weather, as it is perfectly weatherproof. 

II. — .Mix glue water with zinc oxide 
(zinc white) and paint the respective 
object with this mixture. When this is 
dry (after about % hours) it is followed 
up with a coating of glue water and zinc 
chloride in a highly diluted state. Zinc 
oxide enters into a chemical combination 
with zinc chloride, which acquires the 
hardness of glass and a mirror-hke 
bright surface. Any desired colors can 
be prepared with the glue water (size) 
and are practically imperishable. Ihis 
zinc coating is very durable, dries quick- 
ly, and is 50 per cent cheaper than oil 
paint. 

Water- and Acid -Resisting Paint.— 
Caoutchouc is melted with colophony at 
a low temperature, after the caoutchouc 
has been dried in a drying closet (stove) 
at 158° to 176° F., until no more con- 
siderable increase in weight is P^epU-

PAINTS FOR WOOD: 

See also Wood. 

Floor Coating.— A new paint for floors, 
especially those of soft wood: Mix to- 
gether 2.2 pounds joiners glue; a little 
over 1 ounce powdered bichromate ot 
potash; 3£ ounces aniline brown; arid 
10 i quarts water in a tin vessel. After 
6 hours have elapsed (when the glue is 
completely soaked), heat gradually to 
the boiling point. The coating becomes 
perfectly water-tight after 2 or 3 days; it 
is not opaque, as the earthy body is lack- 
ing. The glue causes the wood fibers 
to be firmly united. It becomes in- 
soluble by the addition of bichromate 
of potash, under the influence of light. 
Without this admixture a simple glue 
coat has formerly not been found satis- 
factory, as it dissolves if cleaned with 
water. 

Durable House Paint. — I. — New 
houses should be primed once with pure 
Unseed oil, then painted with a thin 
paint from white lead and chalk, and 
thus gradually covered. The last coat 
s prepared of well-boiled varnish, white 
lead, and chalk. The chalk has the

thin, hot, white glue. When the COaf . 
thoroughly dry, the glue i s rubbed !S 
again with hne glass paper. The 
is prepared as follows: Take 3 nr^^ 3 
(more or less, according to the niii dii 
of articles) of the purest and best o 11 
dion; grind upon a clean grinding S 
twice the quantity that can be taken 6

one-half of the collodion i s poured-t 
this add the ground white, which can h 
removed clean from the stone by ma^T 
of a good spatula and put in the bottl 3 
Add about 100 drops of linseed oil and 
shake the mass till it looks like milk! 

Now painting with this milky "s^. 
stance may be commenced, using a fine 
hair pencil of excellent quality. The 
pencil is not dipped in the large bottle- 
but a glass is kept at hand with an open- 
ing of about 1 inch, so as to be able to 
immerse the pencil quickly. The sub- 
stance is not flowing like the alcohol 
lacquers, for which reason it may be put 
on thick, for the ether, chiefly consti- 
tuting the mass, evaporates at once and 
leaves but a very thin film which becomes 
noticeable only after about 10 such 
applications have been made. Shake 
the bottle well each time before filling 
the small glass, as the heavy Krems 
white is very apt to sink to thf bottom of 
the bottle. If it is observed that the 
substance becomes too thick, which may 
easily occur on account of the evapora- 
tion, a part of the remaining ether is 
added, to which in turn 30 to 40 drops 
of oil are added, shaking it till the oil 
appears to be completely dissolved. 

The operator must put on the mass 
in quick succession and rather thick- 
After about 10 coats have been applied 
the work is allowed to rest several hours; 
then 3 or 4 coats of pure collodion, to 
which likewise several drops of oil have 
been added, are given. Another pause 
of several hours having been allowed to 
intervene, application of the mass is once 
more begun. 

When it is noticed that a layer of fh, e 
thickness of paper has formed, the arti- 
cles, after drying thoroughly, should w 
softly rubbed off with very fine gio» 
paper, after which they require to oe 
wiped off well with a clean linen rag, so 
that no dust remains. Then coating * 
continued till the work seems serviceable-

Coating for Name Plates. — A durable 
coating for name plates in nurseries is 
produced as follows: Take a woolen ra^ 
Kate it with joiners' polish lay it 
Sa linen one, and rub the wooden sur- 
face with this for some time Rub down 
with sandpaper and it can be written on 
almost like 'paper. When all is dry 
coat with dammar lacquer for better 
protection. If the wood is to receive a 
color it is placed in the woolen rag before 
rubbing down, in this case chrome 
yellow. 

To Keep Flies from Fresh Paint. — For 
the purpose of keeping flies and other 
insects awav from freshly painted sur- 
faces mix a little bay oil (laurel oil) with 
the oil paint, or place a receptacle con- 
taining same in the vicinity of the painted 
objects. The pungent odor keeps off 
the flies. 

Heat-Indicating Paint. — A heat-indi- 
cating paint composed of a double iodide 
of copper and mercury was first dis- 
covered years ago by a German physi- 
cist. At ordinary temperatures ^the 
paint is red, but when heated to 206° F. 
it turns black. Paper painted with this 
composition and warmed at a stove ex- 
hibits the change in a few seconds. A 
yellow double iodide of silver and mer- 
cury is even more sensitive to heat, 
changing from yellow to dark red. 

To Keep Liquid Paint in Workable 
Condition. — To prevent liquid paint 
which, for convenience sake, is kept in 
small quantities and flat receptacles, 
from evaporating and drying, give the 
vessels such a shape that they can be 
placed one on top of the other without 
danger of falling over, and provide the 
under side with a porous mass — felt or 
very porous clay, etc. — which, if mois- 



tened, will retain the water for a long 
time. Thus, in placing the dishes one 
on top of the other, a moist atmosphere is 
created around them, which will inhibit 
evaporation and drying of the paint. A 
similar idea consists in producing covers 
with a tight outside and porous inside, 
for the purpose of covering up, during 
intermission in the work, clay models 
and like objects which it is desired to 
keep soft. In order to avoid the forma- 
tion of fungous growth on the constantly 
wet bottom, it may be saturated with' 
non-volatile disinfectants, or with vola- 
tile ones if their vapors are calculated to 
act upon the objects kept underneath the 
cover. If the cover is used to cover up 
oil paints, it is moistened on the inside 
with volatile oil, such as oil of turpentine, 
oil of lavender, or with alcohol. 

Peeling of Paints". — For the preven- 
tion of peeling of new coatings on old oil 
paintings or lakes, the latter should be 
rubbed with roughly ground pumice 
stone, wet by means of felt rags, and to 
the first new coat there should be added 
fine spirit in the proportion of about 
-fLjr of the thinning necessary for stir- 
ring (turpentine, oil, etc.)- This paint 
dries well and has given good results, 
even in the most difficult cases. 1 he 
subsequent coatings are put on with the 
customary paint . Fat, oil S\??™J™ 
graining are likewise mixed with spirit 
whereby the cracking of the varnish 
coating is usually entirely obviated. 

Polychroming of Figures.— This paint 
consists of white wax 1

and work it until free from l Un "J 
finely kneaded and sticky enough to art 
here to the surface of a planed board 
If it is too dry to stick fast add a f 6 S 
drops of cither glue or water, and work 
it up again. When the paper pulp £ 
poor and the mache is inclined to be 
lumpy, lay the mass upon a smooth 
board, take a hammer and pound it hard 
to grind it up fine. 

If the papier mache is not sticky enough 
to adhere firmly to whatever it is rubbed 
upon, it is a failure, and requires more 
glue. In using it the mass should be 
kept in a lump arid used as soon as 
possible after making. Keep the sur- 
face of the lump_ moist by means of a \r e t 
cloth laid over it, for if you do not, the 
surface will dry rapidly. If it i s to be 
kept overnight, or longer, wrap it up in 
several thicknesses of wet cotton cloth 
and put under an inverted bowl. If it 
is desired to keep a lump for a week, to 
use daily, add a few drops of glycerine 
when making, so that it will dry more 
slowly. 

The papier mache made according to 
this formula has the following qualities: 
When tested by rubbing between the 
thumb and finger, it was sticky and cov- 
ered the thumb with a fine coating. 
(Had it left the thumb clean, it would 
have been because it contained too 
much water.) When rubbed upon a 
pane of glass it sticks tightly and dries 
hard in 3 hours without cracking, and 
can only be removed with a knife. 
When spread in a layer as thin as writing 
paper it dries in half an hour. A mass 
actually used dried hard enough to coat 
with wax in 18 hours, and, without 
cracking, became as hard as wood; yet 
a similar quantity wrapped in a wet cloth 
and placed under an inverted bowl kept 
soft and fit for use for an entire week.

Safety Paper. — White paper pulp

tinned with any stain easily affected by 
chlorine, acids, alkalies, etc., and made 
into sheets as vaual, serves as a safety 
paper on which to write checks or the

ing 'affects the whole surface, showing

Tracing Paper.— Open a quire of 
smooth, unsized white paper, and place 
it flat upon a table. Apply, with a clean 
sash tool to the upper surface of the first 
sheet, a coat of varnish made of equal 
parts of Canada balsam and oil of tur- 
pentine, and hang the prepared sheet 
across the line to dry; repeat the opera- 
tion on fresh sheets until the proper 
quantity is finished. If not sufficiently 
transparent, a second Coat of varnish 
may be applied as soon as the first has 
become quite dry. 

Strengthened Filter Paper. — -When or- 
dinary filter paper is dipped into nitric 
acid (specific gravity, 1.42), thoroughly 
washed and dried, it becomes a tissue of 
remarkable properties, and one that de- 
serves to be better known by chemists 
and pharmacists. It shrinks somewhat 
in size and in weight, and gives, on burn- 
ing, a diminished ash. It yields no ni- 
trogen, nor does it in the slightest man- 
ner affect liquids. It remains perfectly 
pervious to liquids, its filtering properties 
being in no wise affected, which, it is 
needless to say, is very different from 
the behavior of the same paper "parch- 
mented" by sulphuric acid. It is as 
supple as a rag, yet may be very roughly 
handled, even when wet, without tearing 
or giving way. These qualities make it 
. very valuable for use in filtration under 
pressure or exhaust. It fits closely to the 
funnel, upon which it may be used direct, 
without any supports, and it thus pre- 
vents undue access of air. As to strength, 
it is increased upward of 10 times. A 
strip of ordinary white Swedish paper, 
i of an inch wide, will sustain a load of 
from J to J of a pound avoirdupois, ac- 
cording to the quality of the paper. A 
similar strin of the toughened paper 



broke, in S trials, with 5 pounds, 7 ounces, 
and 3 drachms; 5 pounds, 4 ounces, and 
30 grains; and 5 pounds, 10 ounces re- 
spectively. These are facts that deserve 
to be better known than they seem to be 
to the profession at large. 

Blotting Paper. — A new blotting paper 
which will^ completely remove wet as 
well as dry ink spots, after moistening the 
paper with water, is produced as follows: 
Dissolve 100 parts of oxalic acid in 400 
parts of alcohol, and immerse porous 
white paper in this solution untd it is 
completely saturated. Next hang the 
sheets up separately to dry over threads. 
Such paper affords ^ great advantages, 
but in its characteristic application i 
serviceable for ferric inks only, whil 
aniline ink spots cannot be removed wit 
it, after drying. 

Carbon Paper. — Many copying paper 
act by virtue of a detachable pigmen* 
which, when the pigmented paper : 
placed between two sheets of white pape 
and when the uppermost paper is wri 
ten on, transfers its pigment to the lowe 
white sheet along lines which correspon 
to those traced on the upper paper, an 
therefore gives an exact copy of them o 
the lower paper. 

The pigments used are fine soot 
ivory black, indigo carmine, ultramann 
and Paris blue, or mixtures of the"

for black copying paper. It is i rubbed

Celloidin Paper. — Ordinary polished 
celluloid and celloidin paper are dif- 
ficult to write upon with pen and ink. 
If, however, the face is rubbed over with 
a chalk crayon, and the dust wiped off 
with a clean rag, writing becomes easy.

In general it may be said that the

Fireproof Papers. — L — Ammonium 
sulphate, 8 parts, by weight; boracie 
acid, 3 parts; borax, 2 parts; water, 100 
parts. The temperature should be about 
122° F. 

II. — For paper, either printed or im- 
printed, bills of exchange, deeds, books, 
etc., the following solution is recom- 
mended: Ammonium sulphate, 8 parts; 
boracie acid, 3 parts; sodium borate, 
1.7 parts; water, 10,000 parts. The so- 
lution is heated to 122° F., and may be 
used when the paper is manufactured. 
As soon as the paper leaves the machine 
it is passed through this solution, then 
rolled over a warm cylinder and dried. 
If printed or in sheets, it is simply im- 
mersed in the solution, at a temperature 
of 122° F., and spread out to dry, finally 
pressed to restore the luster. 

Hydrographic Paper. — This is paper 
which may be written on with simple 
water or with some colorless liquid hav- 
ing the appearance of water. 

I. — A mixture of nut galls, 4 parts, and 
calcined sulphate of iron, 1 part (both 
perfectly dry and reduced to very fine 
powder), is rubbed over the surface of 
the paper, and is then forced into its 
pores by powerful pressure, after which 
the loose portion is brushed off. J- n ® 
writing shows black when a pen dipped 
m water is used. 

II. — A mixture of persulphate of n*o° 
and ferrocyanide of potassium, may. De

Lithographic paper is written on with 
lithographic ink. The writing is trans- 
ferred simply by moistening the back or 
the paper, placing it evenly on the stone 
and then applying pressure. A reversed 
copy is obtained, which, when printed 
from, yields corrected copies resembling 
the original writing or drawing. In this 
way the necessity of executing the writ- 
ing or drawing in a reversed direction is 
obviated. 

MARBLING PAPER FOR BOOKS. 

Provide a wooden trough % inches deep 
and the length and width of any desired 
sheet; boil in a brass or copper pan a 
quantity of linseed and water until a 
thick mucilage is formed; strain it mto 
a trough, and let cool; then grind on a 
marble slab any of the following colors 
in small beer: 

For Blue. — Prussian blue or indigo. 

Red. — Rose pink, vermilion, or drop 
lake. 

Yellow. — King's yellow, yellow ocher, 
etc. 

White.— Flake white. 

Black. — Burnt ivory or lampblack. 

Brown. — Umber, burnt; terra di 
sienna, burnt. 

Black mixed with yellow or red also 
makes brown. 

Green. — Blue and yellow mixed. 

Orange. — Red and yellow mixed. 

Purple. — Red and blue mixed. 

For each color have two cups, one for 
the color after grinding, the other to mix 
it with ox gall, which must be used to 
thin the colors at discretion. If too 
much gall is used, the colors will spread. 
"When they keep their place on the sur- 
face of the trough, -when moved with a 
quill, they are fit for use, AH things in 



readiness, the colors are successively 
sprinkled on the surface of the mucilage 
in the trough with a brush, and are waved 
or drawn about with a quill or a stick, 
according to taste. When the design is 
just formed, the book, tied tightly be- 
tween cutting boards of the same size, is 
lightly pressed with its edge on the sur- 
face of the liquid pattern, and then with- 
drawn and dried. The covers may be 
marbled in the same way, only letting the 
liquid colors run over them. In mar- 
bling paper the sides of the paper are gent- 
ly applied to the colors in the trough. 
The film of color in the trough may be as 
thin as possible, and if any remains after 
the marbling it may be taken off by ap- 
plying paper to it before you prepare 
for marbling again. To diversify the 
effects, colors are often mixed with a 
little sweet oil before sprinkling them on, 
by which means a light halo or circl 
appears around each spot. 

WATERPROOF PAPERS. 

I, — Wall papers may be easily ren 
dered washable, either before or afte 
they are hung, by preparing them in the 
following manner: Dissolve 2 parts of 
borax and 2 parts of shellac in 24 parts 
of water, and strain through a fine cloth. 
With a brush or a sponge apply this to 
the surface of the paper, and when it l 
dry, polish it to a high gloss with a soft 
brush. Thus treated the paper may be 
washed without fear of removing the 
even smearing or blurring 



or 



colors 
them. 

IX This is recommended for drawing 

paper. Any kind of paper is lightly primed 
with glue or a suitable binder to which a 
finely powdered inorganic body, such as 
zinc white, chalk, lime, or heavy spar as 
well as the desired coloring matter for the 
paper, are added. Next the paper thus
