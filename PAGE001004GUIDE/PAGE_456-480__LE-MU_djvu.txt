LENSES AND THEIR CARE: 

Unclean Lenses (see also Cleaning Prep- 
arations and Methods). — If in either ob- 
jective or eyepiece the lenses are not 
clean, the definition may be seriously im- 

E aired or destroyed. Uncleanlmess may 
e due to finger marks upon the front lens 
of the objective, or upon the eyepiece 
lenses; dust which in time may settle upon 
the rear lens of the objective or on the 
eye lens; a film which forms upon one or 
the other lens, due occasionally to the fact 
that glass is hygroscopic, but generally 
tothe exhalation from the interior finish 
ot the mountings, and, in immersion ob- 
jectives, because the front lens is not 
properly cleaned; or oil that has leaked 
on to its rear surface, or air bubbles that 
have formed in the oil between the cover 
glass and front lens.

Dry Objectives. — Clean the front lens 
as described. To examine the rear and in- 
terior lenses use a 2-inch magnifier, look- 
ing through the rear. > Remove the dust 
from the rear lens with a camel' s-hair 
brush. 

Oil Immersion Objectives. — Invariably 
clean the front lens after use with moist- 
ened linen or paper, and wipe dry. 

In applying oil examine the front of 
the objective with a magnifier, and if there 
are any air bubbles, remove them with a 
pointed quill, or remove the ail entirely 
and apply a fresh quantity.

Lettering 

CEMENTS FOR ATTACHING- LETTERS 
ON GLASS: 

See Adhesives, under Sign-Letter Ce- 
ments, 

Gold Lettering. — This is usually done 
by first drawing the lettering, then cover- 
ing with an adhesive mixture, such as size, 
and finally applying gold bronze powder 
or real gold leaf. A good method for 
amateurs to follow in marking letters on 
glass is to apply first a coat of whiting, 
mixed simply with water, and then to 
mark out the letters on this surface^ 
using a pointed stick or the like. Alter 
this has been done the letters may easily 
be painted or gilded on the reverse s»de£l 
the glass. When done, wash off tue 
whiting from the other side, and the worn 
is complete. 

Bronze Lettering.— The f°"^ in fj 
the best method for card work: Write v 
asplialtum thinned with turpentine umg 
it flows easilj'-, and, when nearly ^^en 
bronze powder over the letters, vvn 
the letters are perfectlv dry tap 
*o take off the extra bronze, and 
leave the letters clean and sharp. , 
letters should be made with a f^J* 
hair brush and not with the a ut0 *"? aC . 
pen, as oil paints do not work saO" 
torily with these pens. . , pe n, 

For bronzed letters made with tn ^ or .

Tf a water color is used add considerable 
inm arable. Each letter should be 
Bronzed as it is made, as the water color 
dries much more quickly than the as- 

^Another method is to mix the bronze 
nowder with bronze sizing to about the 
insistency of the asphaltum. Make the 
letter with a camel's-hair brush, using the 
bronze paint as one would any oil paint. 

This method requires much skill, as 
the eold paint spreads quickly and is apt 
to flood over the edge of the letter. For 
use. on oilcloth this is the most practical 

method. , 

Bronzes may be purchased at any 
hardware store. They are made in 
copper, red, green, silver, gold, and cop- 
per shades. 

Lettering on Glass. — White lettering 
on glass and mirrors produces a rich 
effect. Dry zinc, chemically pure, should 
be used. It can be obtained jn any first- 
class paint store and is inexpensive. To 
every teaspoonful of zinc, 10 drops of 
mucilage should be added. The two 
should be worked up into a thick paste, 
water being gradually added until the 
mixture is about the consistency of thick 
cream. The paint should then be ap- 
plied with a camel's-hair brush. 

Another useful paint for this purpose 
is Chemnitz white. If this distemper 
color is obtained in a jar, care should be 
exercised to keep water standing above 
the color to prevent drying. By using 
mucilage as a sizing these colors will ad- 
here to the glass until it is washed off. 
Both mixtures are equally desirable for 
lettering on block card-board. 

Any distemper color may be employed 
on glass without in any way injuring it. 
An attractive combination is — first to 
letter the sign with Turkey red, and then 
to outline the letters with a very narrow 
white stripe. The letter can be ren- 
dered still more attractive by shading one 
side in black. 

Signs on Show Cases. — Most show 
cases have mirrors at the back, either m 
the form of sliding panels or spring 
doors. Lettering in distemper colors 
on these mirrors can easily be read 
through the fronts or tops of cases. If 
the mirror is on a sliding panel, it will 
be necessary to detach it from the case 
in order to letter it. When the mirror 
is on a spring door the sign can be let- 
tered with less trouble. 

By tracing letters in chalk on the out- 
side of the glass, and then painting 
them on the inside, attractive signs can 
roduced on all show cases ; but paint- 



ing letters on the inside of a show case 
glass is more or less difficult, and it is 
not advisable to attemptit in very shallow 
cases. 

"Spatter" Work. — Some lettering 
which appears very difficult to the unin- 
itiated is, in fact, easily produced. The 
beautiful effect of lettering and orna- 
mentation in the form of foliage or con- 
ventional scrolls in a speckled ground is 
simple and can be produced with little 
effort. Pressed leaves and letters or 
designs cut from newspapers or maga- 
zines may be tacked or pasted on card- 
board or a mat with flour paste. As 
little paste as possible should be used — 
only enough to hold the design in place. 
When all the designs are in the positions 
desired, a toothbrush should be dippec 
in the ink or paint to be employed. A 
toothpick or other small piece of wooc 
is drawn to and fro over the bristles, 
which are held toward the sign, the ei 
tire surface of which should be spat 
tered or sprinkled with the color. Whei 
the color is dry the designs pasted 01 
should be carefully removed and thf 
paste which held them in place should be 
scraped off. This leaves the letters and 
other designs clean cut and white agains 
the "spatter" background. The begin 
ner should experiment first with a fe\ 
simple designs. After he is able to pro- 
duce attractive work with a few figure 
or letters he may confidently undertal 
more elaborate combinations. 

Lettering on Mirrors.— From a bar o; 
fresh common brown soap cut off a one 
inch-wide strip across its end. Cut tnis 
into S or 3 strips. Take one strip and 
with a table-knife cut from two opposite 
Tides a wedge-shaped point resembling 

tnat of a shading P«. b «\^,^ C ?K 
to be fully i inch thick. Clean tne 
mir?or thorough^ and P^eeed to letter 
in exactly the same manner as with a 
shading pen.

LICORICE: . 

Stable Solutions of Licorice Juice.— 
A. percolator, with alternate layers jof 
broLn glass, which have been well 
washed, first with hydrochloric acid and 
plentifully rinsed with distilled water, is 
the first requisite. This is charged with 
pieces of crude licorice juice, from the 
size of a hazel nut to that of a walnut, 
•which are weighted down with well- 
washed pebbles. The percolate is kept 
for 3 days in well corked flasks which 
have been rinsed out with alcohol be- 
forehand. Decant and filter and evap- 
orate down rapidly, under constant 
stirring, or in vacuo. The extract 
Bhould be kept in vessels first washed 
with alcohol and closed with parchment 
paper, in a dry place — never in the 
cellar. 

To dissolve this extract, use water, 
first boiled for 15 minutes. The solu- 
tion should be kept in small flasks, first 
rinsed with alcohol and well corked. If 
to be kept for a long time, the flasks 
should be subjected for 3 consecutive 
days, a half hour each day, to a stream of 
steam, and the corks paraffined. 

There is frequently met with in com- 
merce a purified juice that remains clear 
m the mxxtura solvens. It is usually 
obtained by supersaturation with pure 
ammonia, allowing to stand for 3 days, 
decanting, filtering the decanted liquor 
and qmefc evaporation. Since solutions 
with water done rapidly spoil, it is well 

commn.T ^ ^ m the Precautions 
common for narcotic extracts. 



To Test Extract of Licorice. — Mere 
solubility is no test for the purity of 
extract of licorice. It is, theretore, p ro , 
posed to make the glycyrrhizm content 
and the nature of the ash the determining 
test To determine^ the glyeyrrhizhi 



gl 

Quantitatively proceed as follows: Mac- 
erate t\j ounce ot the extract, in coarse 
powder, in 10 fluidounces distilled water 
for several hours, with more or less f re- 
el uent agitation. When solution is com- 
plete add 10 fluidounces alcohol 0 f 90 
per cent, filter and wash the filter with 
alcohol of 40 per cent until the latter 
comes off colorless. Drive off the alco- 
hol which was added merely to facilitate 
filtration, by evaporation in the water 
bath; let the residue cool down and pre- 
cipitate the glycyrrhizin by addiLion of 
sulphuric acid. Filter the liquid and 
wash the precipitate on the filter with 
distilled water until the wash water comes 
off neutral. Dissolve the glycyrrhizin 
from the filter by the addition of ammonia 
water, drop by drop, collecting the fil- 
tered solution in a tared capsule. Evap- 
orate in the water bath, dry the residual 
glvcyrrhmn at 212° F., and weigh. Re- 
peated examinations of known pure ex- 
tracts have yielded a range of percentage 
of odycyrrhizin running from 8.06 per 
cent to '11.90 per cent. The ash should 
be acid in reaction and a total percentage 
of from 5.64 to 8.64 of the extract.

Composition, for Linoleum, Oilcloth,

as litharge, to which ingredients a pro- 
portion of gum tragacanth is to be added, 
replacing a part of the oil and serving to 
impart flexibility to the fabric, and to the 
composition in a pasty mass the property 
of drying more rapidly. In the pro- 
duction of linoleum, the whiting is, re- 
placed in whole or in part by pulverized 
nork. The proportions are approximate- 



ly the following by weight: Whiting or 
powdered eork, 13 parts; gum traga- 
canth, 5 parts; dried lmseed oil, 5£ parts; 
siccative, £ part.

Treatment of Newly Laid Linoletrm.- 
The proper way to cleanse a lincleu 
flooring is first to sweep off the dust and 
then wipe up with a damp cloth. Several 
times a year the surface should be well 
rubbed with floor wax. Care must be 
had that the mass is well pulverized and 
free from grit. Granite linoleum and 
figured coverings are cleansed without 
the application of water. A floor cover- 
ing which has been treated from the 
beginning with floor wax need only be 
wiped off daily with a dry cloth, either 
woolen or felt, and afterwards rubbed 
well with a cloth filled with the mass. 
It will improve its appearance, too, it it 
be washed several times a year witn 
warm water and a neutral soap.

Machinery Oils.— L— The solid fat, 
called bakourine, a heavy lubricant which 
possesses extraordinary lubricating quan- 
tities has a neutral reaction and melts 
only 'at about 176° to 188° P. It is pre- 
pared as follows: 

A mixture is made of 100 parts of 
Bienne petroleum or crude naphtha, 
with 25 parts of castor oil or some min- 
eral oil, and subjected to the action of 60 
or 70 parts of sulphuric acid of 66° Be. 
The acid is poured in a small stream into 
the oil, while carefully stirring. The 
agitation is continued until a thick and 
blackish-brown mass is obtained free 
from non-incorporated petroleum. "Very 
cold water of 2 or 3 times the weight of 
the mass is then added, and the whole is 
stirred until the mass turns white and 
becomes homogeneous. It is left at 
rest for 24 hours, after which the watery 
liquid, on the surface of which the fat is 
floating, must be poured off. After 
resting again from 3 to 4 days, the prod- 
uct is drawn off, carefully neutralized 
with caustic potash, and placed in bar- 
rels ready for shipping. 

II.— Melt in a kettle holding 2 to 4 
times as much as the volume of the mass 
which is to be boiled therein, 10 parts, 
by weight, of tallow in 20 parts of rape 
oil on a moderate fire; add 10 parts of 
freshly and well burnt lime, slaked in 
30 or 40 parts of water; increase the hre 
somewhat, and boil with constant stirring 
until a thick froth forms and the mass 
sticks to the bottom of the kettle. Uurn- 
ing should be prevented by diligent stir- 
ring. Then add in portions of 10 P art T

Sust always be kept on hand. Next, 
gradually add in small portions, so as 
f n t to disturb the boiling of the mass, 
500 parts of paraffine oil (if very thick, 
S00 to 900 parts may be added), remove 
from the fire, allow the contents of the 
kettle to clarify, and skim off the warm 
rrrease from the sediment into a stirring 
apparatus. Agitate until the mass be- 
ams to thicken and cool; if the grease 
should still be too solid, stir in a little 
paraffine oil the second time. The odor 
of the paraffine oil may be disguised by 
the admixture of a little mirbane oil. 

For Cutting Tools.— The proportion 
of ingredients of a lubricating mixture 
for cutting tools is 6 gallons of water, 3| 
pounds of soft soap, and % gallon of 
clean refuse oil. Heat the water and mix 
with the soap, preferably in a mechan- 
ical mixer; afterwards add the oil. A 
cast-iron circular tank to hold 12 gallons, 
fitted with a tap at the bottom and hav- 
ing three revolving arms fitted to a ver- 
tical shaft driven by bevels and a fast 
and loose pulley, answers all requirements 
for a mixer. This should be kept run- 
ning all through the working day. 

For Highspeed Bearings.— To prevent 
heating and sticking of bearings on 
heavy machine tools due to running con- 
tinuously at high speeds, take about \ 
of flake graphite, and the remainder 
kerosene oil. As soon as the bearing 
shows the slightest indication of heat- 
ing or sticking, this mixture should be 
forcibly squirted through the oil hole 
until it flows out between the shaft and 
bearing, when a small quantity of thin 
machine oil may be applied. 

For Heavy Bearings. — An excellent 
lubricant for heavy bearings can be made 
from either of the following recipes: 

I.— Paraffine 6 pounds 

Palm oil.. . . 12 pounds 

Oleonaphtha 8 pounds 

II.— Paraffine 8 pounds 

Palm oil 20 pounds 

Oleonaphtha 12 pounds 

The oleonaphtha should have a den- 
sity of 0.9. First dissolve the paraffine 
in the oleonaphtha at a temperature of 
about 158° F. Then gradually stir m 
the palm oil a little at a time. The pro- 
portions will show that No, II £ V( ! s , a 
less liquid product than No. I. Quicic- 



For L atlle Centers—An excellent 
lubricant for lathe centers is made bv 
using 1 part graphite and 4 parts tallow 
thoroughly mixed. 

Sewing Machine Oil. — I , — Petroleum 
oils are better adapted for the lubrication 
of sewing machines than any of the animal 
oils. < Sperm oil has for a long time bee 
considered the standard oil for this pur 
pose, but it is really not well adapted t 
the conditions to which a sewing machin 
is subjected. If the machine were oper 
ated constantly or regularly every da 
probably sperm oil could not be im 
proved on. The difficulty is, howeve 
that a family sewing machine will fr 
quently be allowed to stand untouche 
for weeks at a time and will then be e 
pected to run as smoothly as though just 
oiled. Under this kind of treatment 
almost any oil other than petroleum oil 
will become gummy. What is known in 
the trade as a "neutral" oil, of high 
viscosity, would probably answer better 
for this purpose than anything else. A 
mixture of 1 part of petrolatum and 7 
parts of paraffine oil has also been rec- 
ommended.

then stir in the palm oil. This may be 
gently warmed before adding, as it 
greatly facilitates its incorporation with 
the tallow, unless the latter be made 
boiling hot, when it readily melts the 
semi-solid palm oil. When these two 
greases are thoroughly incorporated, 
pour the mixture slowly into the cold lye 
(or soda solution), and stir well until the 
mass is homogeneous. This lubricant 
can be made less solid by decreasing the 
tallow or increasing the palm oil.

MISCELLANEOUS LUBRICANTS: 

For Cotton Belts. — Carefully melt over 
a slow fire in a closed iron or self-regu- 
lating boiler 250 parts of caoutchouc or 
gum elastic, cut up in small pieces; then 
add 200 parts of colophony; when the 
whole is well melted and mixed, incor- 
porate, while carefully stirring, 200 parts 
of yellow wax. Then heat 850 parts of 
train oil, mixing with it 250 parts of talc, 
and unite the two preparations, con- 
stantly stirring, until completely cold. 

Chloriding Mineral Lubricating Oils.— 
A process has been introduced for pro- 
ducing industrial vaselines and mineral 
oils for lubrication, based on the treat- 
ment of naphthas, petroleums, and simi- 
lar hydrocarbides, by means of chlorine 
or mixtures of chlorides and hypocb oi- 
ides, known under the name of decolor- 
ing chlorides. Mix and stir thorough 
1,000 parts of naphtha of about W*

LUBRICANTS

TTard Metal Drilling Lubricant.— For 

JrlnW in hard metal 11 is recommended 
f ise carbolic acid instead of another 
Sttv substance as a lubricant since the 
i bv decreasing the friction, dimin- 

! 1 es the ''biting" of the drill, whereas 
the carbolic acid has an etching action. 

Plaster Model Lubricant. — Take lin- 
seed oil, 1,000 parts; calcined lead, 50 
rnrts- litharge, 60 parts; umber, 30 parts; 
tile 25 Parts. Boil for 2 hours on a mod- 
erate'fire; skim frequently and keep m 
well-closed flasks. 

Graphite Lubricating Compound.—- 
Graphite mixed with tallow gives a good 
lubricating compound that, is free irom 
any oxidizing if the taliow be rendered 
free from rancidity. The proportions 
are- Plumbago, 1 part; tallow, 4 parts. 
The plumbago being stirred into the 
melted tallow and incorporated by pass- 
ing it through a mixing mill, add a few 
pounds per hundredweight of camphor 
in powder to the hot compound. 

Lubricants for Redrawing Shells.— 
Zinc shells should be clean and free from 
all grit and should be immersed in boil- 
ing hot soap water. They must be re- 
drawn while hot to get the best results. 
On some shells hot oil is used in prefer- 
ence to soap water. 

For redrawing aluminum shells use a 
cheap grade of vaseline. It may not be 
amiss to add that the draw part of the 
redrawing die should not be made too 
long, so as to prevent too much friction, 
which causes the shells to split and shrivel 
up. 

For redrawing copper shells use good 
thick soap water as a lubricant. The 
soap used should be of a kind that will 
produce plenty of "slip." If none such 
is to be had, mix a quantity of lard oil 
with the soap water on hand and boil the 
two together. Sprinkling graphite over 
the shells just before redrawing some- 
times helps out on a mean job. 

Rope Grease. — For hemp ropes, fuse 
together 90 pounds of tallow and 30 
pounds of linseed oil. Then add 20 
pounds of parafEnc, 30 pounds of vase- 
line, and 60 pounds of rosin. Finally mix 
with 10 pounds of graphite, first rubbed 
up with 50 pounds of boiled oil. For 
wire ropes fuse 100 pounds of suint with 
20 pounds of dark colophony (rosm). 
Then stir in 30 pounds of rosin oil and 
10 pounds of dark petroleum. 

Sheet Metal Lubricant. —Mix 1 quart 
of whale oil, 1 pound of white lead, 1 pint 
of water, and 3 ounces of the finest 



graphite. This is applied to the metal 
with a brush before it enters the dies. 

Steam Cylinder Lubricant.— To ob- 
tain a very viscous oil that does not de- 
compose in the presence of steam even at 
a high temperature, it is necessary to ex- 
pose neutral wool fats, that have been 
freed from wool-fatty acids, such as crude 
lanolin or wool wax, either quite alone 
or in combination with mineral oils, to a 
high heat. This is best accomplished in 
the presence of ordinary steam or super- 
heated steam at a heat of 572° F., and a 
pressure of 50 atmospheres, correspond- 
ing with the conditions in the cylinder in 
which it is to be used. Instead of sepa- 
rating any slight quantities of acid that 
may arise, they may be dissolved out as 
neutral salts. 

Wooden Gears. — An excellent lubri- 
cating agent for wooden_ gears consists 
of talTow, 30 parts (by weight); palm oil, 
20 parts; fish oil, 10 parts; and graphite, 
20 parts. The fats are melted at mod- 
erate heat, and the finely powdered and 
washed graphite mixed with them inti- 
mately by long-continued stirring. The 
teeth of wooden combs are kept in a 
perfectly serviceable condition for a 
much longer time if to the ordinary tal- 
low or graphite grease one-tenth part of 
their weight of powdered glass is added. 

TESTS FOR LUBRICANTS. 

In testing lubricants in general, 
great deal depends upon the class o 
work in whieh they are to be employed 
In dealing with lubricating greases the 
specific gravity should always be deter- 
mined. The viscosity is, of course, als< 
a matter of the utmost importajice. 1 
possible the viscosity should be taken a 
the temperature at which the 
u„ -Hhiectcd when used, but this canno 
always be done; 300° F. will be found to 
be a very suitable temperature for the 
determStion of the viscosity of ! h«wy 
lubricants. . Although one . ol th^stan

The vi^ositv of dynamo oils, taken in

W° g F, and at 122° F. In dealing 
with wagon oils and greases it should be 
wmcmblred that the best kinds are 
those which are free from rosin and 
rosin products, and their flash point 
should be above 212° F. 

To Test Grease.— To be assured of the 
purity of grease, its density is examined 
as compared with water; a piece of fat of 
the size of a pea is placed in a glass of 
water. If it remains on the surface or 
sinks very slowly the fat is pure; if it 
sinks rapidly to the bottom the fat is 
mixed with heavy matters and coom is 
the result.

MAGNETIC CURVES OF IRON FIL- 
INGS, THEIR FIXATION. 

One of the experiments made in every 
physical laboratory in teaching the ele- 
ments of magnetism and electricity is 
the production of the magnetic curves by 
sprinkling iron filings over a glass plate, 
after the well-known method. 

For fixing these curves so that they 
may be preserved indefinitely, a plate ot 
glass is warmed on the smooth upper 
surface of a shallow iron chest containing 
water raised to a suitable temperature 
by means of a spirit-lamp. A piece o 
para (fine is placed on the glass, ana m 
the course of 3 or 4 minutes spreaai 
itself evenly in a thin layer over the su - 
face. The glass plate is removed, tg 
surplus paraffine running on- . 
image is formed with iron filings on v» 
cooled paraffine, which docs not acme 
to the iron, so that if the image W ug 
satisfactory the filings may be rein ^ 
and a new figure taken. To fx , 
curves, the plate of glass is again i p ^ 
on the warming stove. Finally, y^hite 
face of the paraffine is covered Witn j. 
paint, so that the curves appeal " fine d 
on a white ground. Very we 4 g^jilal

MANTLES. 

These are prepared after processes 
differing slightly from one another, but 
all based on the original formula of 
Welsbach— the impregnation of vege- 
table fibers with certain mineral oxides 
in solution, drying out, and arranging 
on platinum wire. 

Lanthanum oxide ... 30 parts 

Yttrium oxide 20 parts 

Burnt magnesia 50 parts 

Acetic acid 50 parts 

Water, distilled 100 parts 

The salts are dissolved in the water, 
and to the solution another 150 parts of 
distilled water are added and the whole 
filtered. The vegetable _ fiber (in its 
knitted or woven form) is impregnated 
with this solution dried, and arranged on 
platinum wire. In the formula _ the 
acetic acid may be replaced with dilute 
nitric acid. The latter seems to have 
some advantages over the former, among 
which is the fact that the residual ash 
where acetic acid is used has a tendency 
to ball up and make a vitreous residue, 
while that of the nitric acid remains in 
powdery form. 

Self-Igniting Mantles. — A fabric of 
platinum wire and cotton thread > is 
sewed or woven into the tissue of the in- 
candescent body; next it is impregnated 
with a solution of thorium salts and 
dried. The thorium nitrate in glowing 
gives a very loose but nevertheless fire- 
proof residue. A mixture of thorium 
nitrate with platinic chloride leaves after 



incandescence a fire-resisting sponge 
possessing to a great extent th? property 
of igniting gas nnxturcs containing oxy-

are to be dipped, and then exposed to

formed into a uniform paste, into which 
the matches are dipped, as before. 
This is cheaper than the previous one.

38 parts. Proceed as above. 

Matches tipped with II, III, or IV, 
inflame without fulmination when rubbed 
against a rough surface, and are hence 
termed noiseless matches by the makers. 

Safety Paste for Matches. — The dan- 
ger of explosion during the preparation 
of match composition may be mini- 
mized by addition to the paste of the 
following mixture: Finely powdered 
cork, 3 parts, by weight; oxide of iron, 
15 parts; flour, 23 parts; and water, 
about 40 parts. In practice, 30 parts of 
gum arabic are dissolved in water, 40 
parts, and to the solution are added 
powdered potassium chlorate, 57 parts, 
and when this is well distributed, amor- 
phous phosphorus, 7 parts, and pow- 
dered glass, 15 parts, are stirred in. The 
above mixture is then immediately in- 
troduced, and when mixing is complete, 
the composition can be applied to 
Wooden sticks which need not have been 



previously dried or paraffined. The 

nnliZ' i h P revents atmospheric 

action and also spontaneous ignition. 

Most chemists agree that the greatest im- 
provement of note in the manufacture of 
matches is that of Landstrom, of Jon- 
koping, m < Sweden. It consists in 
dividing the ingredient of the match mix- 
ture into two separate compositions, one 
being placed on the ends of the splints 
as usual, and the other, which contains 
the phosphorus, being spread in a thin 

i£r r , \ ] P on the end or lid of th e box. 
1 he following are the compositions used: 
(a) For the splints: Chlorate of potassa, 
6 parts; sulphuret of antimony, 2 to 3 
parts; glue, 1 part. (6) For the friction 
surface: Amorphous phosphorus, 10 
parts; sulphuret of antimony or peroxid 
of manganese, 8 parts; glue, 3 to 6 parts 
spread thinly upon the surface, which ha 
been previously made rough by a coating o 
glue and sand. By thus dividing the 
composition the danger of fire arising 
from ignition of the matches by acci- 
dental friction is avoided, as neither the 
portion on the splint nor that on the box 
can be ignited by rubbing against an un- 
prepared surface. Again, by using the 
innocuous red or amorphous phosphorus, 
the danger of poisoning is entirely pre^- 
vented.

cast from the metal too early and by 
use of force, fine pieces are liable to 
break off and remain adhering tc the

mold from the concave one, it is laid in 
water for a short time, so that it be- 
comes saturated with the water it ab- 
sorbs. The dripping, wet mold is again 
provided with an edge, and plaster ol 
Paris is poured on. The latter readily 
flows out on the wet surface, and only m 
rare cases blisters will form. Naturally 
this casting method will furnish a surface 
of pure gypsum, which is not the case 
if the plaster is poured into a greased 
mold. In this case the surface of the 
cast contains a soapy layer, for the liquid 
plaster forms with oil a subsequently

The curd is to be eaten with a spoon 
not drunk, and preferably with some 
bread broken into it. It is also some- 
times eaten with sugar, which is said not 
to impair its digestibility. 



MEAD. 

In its best form Mead is made as fol- 
lows: 12 gallons of pure, soft water (clean 
rain water is, next to distilled water, 
best) are mixed with 30 pounds of ex- 
pressed honey in a big caldron, 4 ounces 
of hops added, and the whole brought 
to a boil. The boiling is continued 
with diligent skimming, for at least an 
hour and a half. The fire is then drawn, 
and the liquid allowed to cool down 
slowly. When cold, it is drawn off into 
a clean barrel, which it should fill to the 
bung, with a little over. A pint of fresh 
wine yeast or ferment is added, and the 
barrel put in a moderately warm place, 
with the bung left out, to ferment for 
from 8 to 14 days, according to the 
weather (the warmer it is the shorter 
the period occupied in the primary or 
chief fermentation). Every day the 
foam escaping from the bung should be 
carefully skimmed off, and every 2 or 3 
days there should be added a little honey 
and water to keep the barrel quite tun, 
and in the meantime a pan or cup snouia 
be inverted over the hole, to keep out 
dust, insects, etc. When fermentation 
ceases, the procedure vanes. oo*»

MEERSCHAUM: 

To Color a Meerschaum Pipe. — I. — Fill 
the pipe and smoke down about one- 
third, or to the height to which you wish 
to color. Leave the remainder of the 
tobacco in the pipe, and do not empty or 
disturb it for several weeks, or until the 
desired color is obtained. When smok- 
ing put fresh tobacco on the top and 
smoke to the same level. A new pipe 
should never be smoked outdoors in 
extremely cold weather. 

IF — The pipe is boiled in a prepara- 
tion of wax, 8 parts; olive oil, 2 parts; 
and nicotine, 1 part, for 10 or 15 minutes. 
The pipe absorbs this, and a thin coating 
of wax is held on the surface of the pipe, 
and made to take a high polish. Under 
the wax is retained the oil of tobacco, 
^hich is absorbed by the pipe; and its 
hue grows darker in proportion to the to- 
bacco used. A meerschaum pipe at 
nrst should be smoked very slowly, and 
before a second bowlful is lighted the 
pipe should cool off. This is to keep the 
"Wax as far up on the bowl as possible; 
rapid smoking will overheat, driving the 
^•x ofF and leaving the pipe dry and 

To Repair Meerschaum Pipes. — To

with a greenish froth. Then quickly 
immerse them in a vessel containing 
plenty of water, and wash them out well 
with running water. Before entering 
the dipped articles in the baths it is well 
to remove all traces of acid, by passing 
them through a weak soda or potassium

again. If the brightly dipped goods are 
to remain bright they must be coated

ftnee is desired for metals the article i a 
corroded either mechanically or cheniic 
ally In the first case it is pierced with 
fine holes near together, rubbed with 
emery powder or pumice stone and tarn- 
penned. In the other case the corrosion 
is effected in acid baths thus composed- 

Nitric acid of 36° Be., 200 parts, by 
volume; sulphuric acid of 56° Be., aoo 
parts, by volume; sea salt, 1 part, by 
volume; zinc sulphate, 1 to 5 parts, by 
volume. . 

With this proportion of acids the 
articles can remain from 5 to 20 minutes 
in the mixture cold; the prominence of 
the matt depends on the length of time 
of the immersion. The pieces on being 
taken from the bath have an earthy ap- 
pearance which is lightened by dipping 
them quickly in a brightening acid. IE 
left too long the matted appearance is 
destroyed. 

Cotton Matt. — This matt, thus called 
on account of its soft shade, is rarely 
employed except for articles of stamped 
brass, statuettes, or small objects. As 
much zinc is dissolved in the bath as it 
will take. The pieces are left in it from 
15 to 30 minutes. On coming from the 
bath they are dull, and to brighten them 
somewhat they are generally dipped into 
acids as before described. 

Silver Matt.— Articles of value for 
which gilding is desired are matted by 
covering them with a light coating of 
silver by the battery. It is known that 
this deposit is always matt, unless the 
bath contains too large a quantity ot 
potassium cyanide. A brilliant silvering 
can be regularly obtained with electric 
baths only by adding carbon sulp^

vious injurious effect at ail. 

COLORING METALS: 

See also Plating- 
Processes by Oxidation. — By heat:— 
Coloration of Steel.— The steel, heated 
uniformly, is covered in the air with a 
pellicle of oxide and has successively the 
following colors: Straw yellow, blue (480° 
to 570° P.), violet, purple, water-green, 
disappearance of the color; lastly the steel 
reddens. For producing the blue read- 
ily, plunge the object into a bath of 25 
parts of lead and 1 part of tin; its tem- 
perature is sufficient for bluing small 
pieces. 

Bronzing of Steel. — I.— The piece to 
be bronzed is wet by the use of a sponge 
with a solution formed of iron perchlor- 
ide, eupric sulphate, and a nitric acid. 
It is dried in a stove at 86° F., then kept 
for 20 minutes over boiling water. It is 
dried again at 86° F., and rubbed with a 
scratch brush. 

This operation is repeated several 
times. 

Bronzing of Steel.— II. — Rust and 
grease are removed from the objects 
with a paste of whiting and soda. They 
are immersed in a bath of dilute sul- 
phuric acid, and rubbed with very fine 
pumice-stone powder. They are then 
exposed from 2 to 3 minutes to the vapor 
of a mixture of equal parts of concen- 
trated chlorhydric and nitric acids. 

The object is heated to 570° to 660° F. 
until the bronze color appears. When 
cooled, it is covered with paraffine or 
vaseline while rubbing, and heated a 
second time until the vaseline or paraf- 
fine commences to decompose. The 
operation is repeated. The shades ob- 
tained are beautiful, and the bronzing is 
not changeable. By subjecting the ob- 
ject to the vapors of the mixture of chlor- 
hydric and nitric acids, shades of a light 
reddish brown are obtained. By add- 
ing to these two acids acetic acid, beau- 
tiful yellow bronze tints are procured. 
By varying the proportion of these three 
acids, all the colors from light reddish 
brown to deep brown, or from light 
yellow bronze to deep yellow bronze, are 
produced at will. 

Bronzing. — III. — Under the name of 
Tuker bronze, a colored metal is found 
m trade which imitates ornamental 
bronze perfectly. It is obtained by de- 
oxidizing or, if preferred, by burnishing 
cast iron. A thin layer of linseed oil or 
of linseed-oil varnish is spread on. It is 
heated at a temperature sufficient for 



of ^W min f % °P ett air the oxidation 
of the metal. The temperature is raised 
more or less, according as a simple yel- 
low coloration or a deep brown is desired 



Lustrous Black -In a quantity of oil 
of turpenbne, sulphuric acid is poured 
drop by drop, stunng continually until 
a precipitate is no longer formed. Then 
the whole is poured into water, shaken, 
decanted, and the washing of the pre 
cipitate commenced again until blue 
litmus paper immersed in the water is 
no longer reddened. The precipitate 
will thus be completely freed from acid 
After having drained it on a cloth, it is 
ready for use. It is spread on the iron 
and burned at the fire. 

If the precipitate spreads with diffi- 
culty over the metal, a little turpentine 
can be added. It is afterwards rubbed 
with a linen rag, soaked with linseed oil, 
until the surface assumes a beautiful 
lustrous black. This covering is not 
liable to be detached. 

Bluish Black. — Make a solution com- 
posed of nitric acid, 15 parts; cupric 
sulphate, 8 parts; alcohol, 20 parts; and 
water, 125 parts. Spread over the metal 
when well cleaned and grease removed. 
Dry and rub with linen rag. 

Black. — Make a solution composed of 
cupric sulphate, 80 parts; alcohol, 40 
parts; ferric chloride, SO parts; nitric 
acid, 20 parts; ether, 20 parts; water, 
400 to 500 parts, and pass over the ob- 
ject to be blackened. 

Magnetic Oxide.— I.— A coating of 
magnetic oxide preserves from rust. 
To obtain it, heat the object in a fur- 
nace to a temperature sufficient to de- 
compose steam. Then inject from 4 to 
6 hours superheated steam at 1,100 M 
The thickness of the layer of oxide 
formed varies with the duration of the 
operation. This, process may replace 
zmcking, enameling, or tinning. ^ 

II.— A deposit of magnetic oxide may 
be obtained by electrolysis.. The iron 
object is placed at the Mode in a bath of 
distilled water heated to 1/G i F The 
cathode is a plate of copper, or the ves- 
sel Its eK if it is of iron or copper B; 
electrolysis a layer of magnetic oxide .a

Deposit of a Metal or of a Hon-Oxi- 
dizable Compound.— Bronze Color.— 
Rub the iron smartly with chloride of 
antimony. A single operation is not 
sufficient. It is necessary to repeat it, 
heating the object slightly. 

Black. — I. — Make a paste composed 
of equal parts of chloride of antimony 
and linseed oil. Spread on the object, 
previously heated, with a brush or rag; 
then pass over it a coating of wax and 
brush it. Finally varnish with gum lac. 

II. — Prepare a solution of bismuth chlo- 
ride, 10 parts; mercury chloride, 20 parts; 
cupric chloride, 10 parts; hydrochloric 
acid, 60 parts; alcohol, 50 parts; water, 
600 parts. Add fuchsine in sufficient 
quantity to mask the color. 

The mercury chloride is poured into 
the hydrochloric acid, and the bismuth 
chloride and cupric chloride added; then 
the alcohol. Employ this mixture with 
*™or a rag for smearing the object. 
1 he object may also be immersed in the 
liquid if it is well cleaned and free from

The object is plunged into this so ution 
after being well cleaned The solution 
may also be applied with a brush, giving 
two^oats. It is afterwards put into hot 
iter The surface of the object is cov-

laver of brown oxide, which adheres 
Pronely to the metal, and which can be 
beautifully burnished, producing the ap- 
pear an ce of bronze. 

Brilliant Black.^The process begins 
bv depositing on the object, perfectly 
clean and free from grease, a layer of 
metallic copper. For this purpose the 
following solutions are prepared; (a) 
Cupric sulphate, 1 part; water, 16 parts. 
Add ammonia until complete dissolu- 
tion Of) Chloride of tin, 1 part; water, 
% parts; and chlorhydric acid 2 parts. 
The object is immersed m solution b, 
and afterwards in solution a. In this 
wav there is deposited on the iron a very 
afferent coating of copper. The object 
washed with water, is afterwards rubbej

iron or steel is first covered with a coat- 
; ll£r of manganese peroxide by immer- 
Jina as an anode in a bath containing 
about 0.05 per cent of chloride or sul- 
fate of manganese and from 5 to 25 per 
cent of ammonium nitrate. ihe bath is 
electrolyzed cold, making use of a cath- 
ode of charcoal. Feeble currents (1 or 
2 amperes) produce an adherent and 
unchangeable deposit. 

Bronzing of Cannon. — Prepare a solu- 
tion of ferric chloride of density 1.2S1, 
14 parts; mercury chloride, 3 parts; fum- 
ing nitric acid, 3 parts; cupric sulphate, 
S parts; water, 80 parts. Give to the 
piece of ordnance 2 or 3 coatings of the 
solution, taking care always to scratch 
the preceding layer with a steel brush 
before spreading the second. Afterwards, 
the object is plunged in a solution of 
potassium sulphide in 900 parts of water. 
It is left in this for 10 days. It is removed 
by washing with soap and hot water. 
The object is rinsed, dried, and finally 
brushed with linseed-oil varnish. 

Green Bronzing. — Dissolve 1 part of 
acetate of silver in 20 parts of essence of 
lavender; coat the surface of iron with 
this liquid by means of a brush and raise 
the temperature to 292° F. A brilliant 
green color is developed on the surface. 

Coating on Steel Imitating Gilding.— 
The abject is hist covered by the gal- 
vanic method by means of a solution of 
cyanide of copper and potassium, then 
covered elcctrolytically with a thin de- 
posit of zinc. It is dried and cleaned 
with a little washed chalk and finally 
immersed in boiling linseed oil. The 
surface of the piece after a few seconds, 
at a temperature of 310° F., appears as if 
there had been a real penetration of cop- 
per and zinc; that is to say, as though 
there were a formation of tombac. 

Bronzing of Cast Iron. — The piece, 
^ben scraped, is coppered with the fol- 
lowing bath: Cupric chloride, 10 parts; 
hydrochloric acid, 80 parts; nitric acid, 
10 parts. It is rubbed with a rag and 
washed with pure water, and then 
rubbed with the following solution: Am- 
monium chlorhydrate, 4 parts; oxalic 
aci Q, 1 part; water, 30 parts. 

Gilding of Iron and Steel.— Chloride 
ot gold is dissolved either in oil of tur- 
pentine or in ether, and this solution is 
a Pphed with the brush on the metallic 
surface, after being perfectly scraped. 
lt is allowed to dry, and then heated 
fciore or less strongly for obtaining the 
necessary adherence. When it is dry 
tae gilding is burnished.

Determining Cream. — An apparatus 
for determining cream in milk consists 
of a glass cylinder having a mark about 
half its heirht. and a second mark a little 
above the first. The milk is added up to 
the lower mark, and water up to the 
second. The amount of water thus 
added is about one-fourth the volume of 
the milk, and causes the cream to rise 
more quickly. The tube is graduated 
between the two marks in percentages o 
cream on the undiluted milk. A vertical 
blue strip in the side of the cylmder aids 
the reading of the meniscus.

Pasteurization of Milk.— In order to 
make milk safe for human consumption 
it is necessary to destroy any harmful 
bacteria which may be present. By far 
the most widely use d method is one of 
heat treatment or pasteurization named 
alter its inventor Pasteur. 

There are two methods of pasteurizing 
milk, one known as the "flash" process 
and the other the "holder" process. 

In the first method the milk is heated 
to a temperature of 160 to 165* P. for 
about 1 minute, cooled to about 40° F., 
bottled and placed in refrigerator. In 
the "holder" process the milk is heated 
and kept at a temperature of about 140° 
F. for 30 minutes, cooled as before and 
bottled. 

Pasteurized milk is less easily digested 
by infants as the enzymes which it con- 
tains are destroyed. 

The second method is preferable in 
that the milk does not acquire the 
"cooked" taste and the enzymes are not 
as readily destroyed as in the "flash" 
method which uses a higher temperature. 

Milk Substitute. — Diamalt is a thick 
syrupy mass of pleasant, strong, some- 
what sourish odor and sweetish taste, 
which is offered as a substitute for milk. 
The preparation has been analyzed. Its 
specific gravity is 1.4826; the percentage 
of water fluctuates between 24 and 28 
per cent; the amount of ash is 1.3 per 
cent. There are present: Lactic acid, 
0 718 to 1.51; nitrogenous matter, 4.68 
to 5.06 per cent; and constituents rich in 
nitrogen, about 68 per cent. The latter 
consist principally of maltose. Dissolved 
in water it forms a greenish-yellow mixt- 
ure Turbidness Fs caused by starch 
grains, yeast cells, bacteria, and a shape- 
less coagulum.

Mirrors 

(See also Glass.) 
Mirror Silvering.-Mirror silvering is 
sometimes a misnomer, inasmuch as , the 
coatin" applied to glass in the manu 
facture 0 of mirror, does not always con- 
tain silver. In formula I it is an amal- 
am of mercury and tin. 

I A sheet of pure tin foil, slightly 

larger than the glass plate to be silvered 
is Ipread evenly on a perfectly plane 
stone table having a raised edge, and is 
well cleaned from all dust and inipunty. 
The foil must be free from the slightest 
flaw or crack. The tin is next covered 
uniform! v to a depth of J of an inch 
with mercury, preference being given by 
some to that containing a small propor- 
tion of tin from a previous operation. 
The glass plate, freed from all dust or 
grease, and repolished if necessary, is 
then carefully slid over the mercury. 
This part of the work requires skill and 
experience to exclude all air bubbles, and 
even the best workmen are not successful 
every time. If there is a single bubble or 
scratch the operation must be repeated 
and the tin foil is lost; not a small expense 
for large sizes. When this step has been 
satisfactorily accomplished the remainder 
is easy, The glass plate is loaded with 
heavy weights to press out the excess of 
mercury which is collected and is used 
again. After 24 hours the mirror is 
lifted from the table and placed on edge 
against a wall, where it is left to drain 
well. 

II.— Solution No. 1 is composed as 
follows: To 8 ounces of distilled water, 
brought to a boil, add 12 grains of silver 
nitrate and 12 grains of Rochelle salts. 
Let it come to a boil for 6 to 7 minutes- 
then cool and Biter. 

Solution No. 2 is made as follows: 
Take 8 ounces of distilled water, and 
into a smfll quantity poured into a tum- 
bler put 19 grams of silver nitrate. Stir 
well until dissolved. Then add several 
drops of 26° ammonia until the solution 
becomes clear. Add 16 grains more of

Directions for Silvering: Clean the 
_K SS w ith ammonia and wipe with a 
wet chamois. Then take half and half of 
the two solutions in a graduating glass, 
stirring well with a glass rod. Pour the 
contents on the middle of the glass to be 
silvered. It will spread over the surface 
of itself if the glass is laid flat. Leave it 
until the solution precipitates. 

Silvering Globes. — The insides of globes 
may be silvered, it is said, by the follow- 
ing methods: 

j Take % ounce of clean lead, and 

melt it with an equal weight of pure tin; 
then immediately add £ ounce of bismuth, 
and carefully skim off the dross; remove 
the alloy from the fire, and before it 
grows cold add 5 ounces of mercury, and 
stir the whole well together; then put the 
fluid amalgam into a clean glass, and it 
is fit for use. When this amalgam is 
used for silvering, it should be first 
strained through a linen rag; then gently 
pour some ounces of it into the globe in- 
tended to be silvered; the alloy should be 
poured into the globe by means of a 
paper or glass funnel reaching almost to 
the bottom of the globe, to prevent it 
splashing the sides; the globe should be 
turned every way very slowly, to fasten 
the silvering. 

II. — Make an alloy of 3 ounces of 
lead, 2 ounces of tin, and 5 ounces of 
bismuth. Put a portion of this alloy 
into the globe and expose it to a gentle 
heat until the compound is melted; it 
melts at 197° F.; then by turning the 
globe slowly round, an equal coating 
may be laid on, which, when cold, hard- 
ens and firmly adheres. 

jResilvering Mirrors — If mirrors coated 
with amalgam become damaged they 
may sometimes be successfully repaired 
by one of the following processes: 

I.— Place the old mirror in a weak- 
sol ution of nitric acid — say 5 per cent 
which immediately removes the silver. 
Rinse it a little, and then clean very thor- 
oughly with a pledget of cotton-wool ana 
a mixture of whiting and ammonia. 
Rouge will answer in place of whiting, or, 
as a last extreme, finest levigated pumic|

£w re cheaper that the glass should be 
spnt to the professional mirror-maker. 
The best plan is to use a glass dish al- 
lowing a ft inch margin all round the 
Kof, ins.de. But such a glass dish is 
expensive, having to be made specially, 
there being no regular sizes near enough 
to 4 x 7 or 8 x- 5 (usual mirror sizes). It 
too lar°-e, a dish must perforce be used, 
the sides or ends of which should be filled 
up with sealing wax. Four strips of glass 
are temporarily bound together with 2 
or 3 turns of string, so as to form a hol- 
low square. The side pieces are i inch 
longer outside, and the end pieces £ inch 
wider than the mirror glass. This frame 
is placed in about the center of the dish, 
moistened with glycerine, and the molten 
wax flowed outside of it to a depth of 
about i of an inch or more. For econ- 
omy's sake, good "parcel wax" may be 
used, but best red sealing wax is safer. 
This wax frame may be used repeatedly, 
being cleaned prior to each silvering 
operation. It is the only special ap- 
pliance necessary, and half an hour is a 
iberal time allowance for making it. 

Use a stock solution of silver nitrate of 
the strength of 25 grains to 1 ounce of 
distilled water: Take 2 drachms of sil- 
ver nitrate stock solution and convert it 
to ammonia nitrate, by adding ammonia 
drop by drop until the precipitate is re- 
dissolved. Add 3$ ounces of distilled 
water. 

In another measure take 80 drops 
(approximately 74 minims) of 40 per cent 
formalin. Pour the solution of amnio- 
nic- nitrate of silver into the measure con- 
taining the formalin, then back into the 
original measure, and finally into the 
dish containing the glass to be silvered. 
This should be done rapidly, and the 
dish containing the mirror well rocked

until the silvering is complete, which may 
be ascertained by the precipitation of a 
black, floceulent deposit, and the clearing 



°f the solution. The actual process of 
silvering takes about 2 minutes. 

Cleanliness throughout is of the great- 
est importance. The vessels in which 
the solutions are mixed should be well 
rinsed with a solution of bichromate of 
potash and sulphuric acid, then washed 
out three or four times under the tap, and 



finally with distilled water. For cleana- 
£p *p th f e ? la f for a short tLe fn a 
solution of bichromate of potash to 
wh.ch a little sulphuric acid is added 
The glass is afterwards well rinsed for a 

m - + 1 Ut 5- °X^° under the ^p, flooded 
with distilled, water, and dried with a 
clean linen cloth, A little 
alcohol is then rubbed on \ 
linen handkerchief, which is immediately 
rolled into a pad and used for well polish- 
ing the surface. The cleaning with al- 
cohol is repeated to avoid risk of failure. 

After the mirror has been silveredj 
hold it under the tap and allow water t ' 
flow_over it for about 3 minutes. Rinse 
it with distilled water, and stand it up 
on edge on blotting paper. ^VVhen it i 
quite dry take a pad of very soft wash 
leather, spread a small quantity of fines 
opticians' rouge on a sheet of clean glass 
and well coat the pad with rouge b 
polishing the sheet of glass. A minut 
quantity of rouge is sufficient. Afte_ 
wards polish the mirror by gently rubbin 
the surface with the pad, using a circul 
stroke. 

It will be seen that with this process 
is unnecessary to suspend the mirror i 
the silvering solution, as usually recoir 
mended. The mirror is laid in the dis 
which is a distinct advantage, as th 
progress of the silvering may be watche 
until complete. The film also is mue 
more robust than that obtained by th 
older methods, 

XI — Clean the bare portion of th 
glass by rubbing it gently with fine cot- 
ton, taking care to remove any trace of 
dust and grease. If this cleaning be not 
done very carefully, defects will appear 
around the place repaired. Witt the

KSt with bronze and iron, anS bronze 
will be dealt with first. , ^ 

The cast disk of bronze should be 
turned up level on both sides and the 
edges should be turned or shaped up, tne 
metal being about half an inch thick. 
On the side which was at the bottom in 
casting, a line should be drawn to allow 
for working up the border or frame ot 
the mirror, and on the rest of the smooth 
surface the design should be drawn, not 
having too much detail. It is best to 
mark the lines with a sharp scriber, to 
arevent their effacement during working. 
When the disk is marked out, it should 
be laid on a smoothly planed iron block, 
and the lines punched to a depth of about 
I inch, a punch with round edges being 
used. Then the disk should be turned 
down to just below the surface of the 
punched-in metal, and the border or edge 
ormed, finishing smoothly, but without 
burnishing. The back can be turned 
down and, with the outer edge, bur- 
nished; but the inside of the edge and 
the face of the mirror should be polished 
with fine abrasive powder, and finished 
with fine rouge. When dry, the mirror 
will appear equally bright all over; but

Lunar caustic is frequently used to 
remove warts and moles. It should be 
wrapped in tin foil or placed in a quill so 
that it will not toucli the bare flesh. 
Moisten the raised surface and touch 
with the caustic night and morning. 
Successive layers of skin will dry up and 
peel off. When on a level with the sur- 
rounding flesh apply a healing ointment. 
Let the last crust formed drop without 
touching it. Unless carefully done this 
process may leave a white scar. 

A simple remedy for warts consists m 
wetting and rubbing them several times 
a day in a strong solution of common 
washing soda. The electric treatment, 
however, is now the most popular. 



MORDANTS: 

See also Dyes. 

Mordant for Cement Surfaces. — Take 

?reen vitriol and dissolve it in hot water, 
f the cement is rather fresh add 1 part 
of vinegar for each part of green vitriol. 
Best suited, however, is triple vinegar 
(vinegar containing H P er cent °^ acetic 
acid), which is alone sufficient for well- 
dried places. For such surfaces that 
have been smoothed with a steel tool and 
have hardly any pores, take alcohol, 1 
part, and green vitriol, 10 parts, and 
apply this twice until the iron has ac- 
quired a yellowish color. This mordant 
forms a neutral layer between cement 
and paint, and causes the latter to dry 
well. 



Mordant for Gold Size. — A mordant 

for gold size gilding that has been thor- 
oughly tested and found to be often pref- 
erable to the shellae-mixed article, is 
prepared from yolk of egg and glycerine. 
Hie yolk ot an egg is twirled in a cup 
and up to 30 drops of glycerine are added 
to it. .The more glycerine added, the 
longer the mordant will take to dry. Or 
else an equal portion of ordinary syrup 
is mixed with the yolk of egg. Same 
must be thinly liquid. If the mass be- 
comes too tough it is warmed a little or 
thinned with a few drops of warm water. 
A single application is sufficient. Nat- 
urally, this style of gilding is only prac- 
ticable indoors; it cannot withstand, the in- 
fluence of moisture. 

MORTAR, ASBESTOS. 

Asbestos mortar consists of a mixture 
of asbestos with 10 per cent of whitt

used, which is composed of 80 per cent 
of asbestos and SO per cent of serpei

coarse powder used for the first rougl 
cast, while the finer material is emplovec 
for the second top-plastering. Ihi 
mortar is highly fire-resisting and watei
