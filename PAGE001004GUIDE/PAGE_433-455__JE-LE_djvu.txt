T,ke 40 parts of saltpeter; 30 parts of 
aiunr 30 parte of sea salt; or 100 grams 
S iq >id ammonia; 3 parts sea salt; and 
100 parts water. This is heated without 
ffimg ^ to a boil, and the articles 
Sed into it for from 2 to 3 minutes, 
fig the liquid constantly; after this 
bath they are dipped m alum water and 
then thoroughly rinsed in clean water. 

II —One hundred parts of calcium bro- 
mide and 2 parts of bromium. The ob- 
jects are allowed to remain in this solu- 
tion (which must be also constantly 
stirred) for from 2 to 3 minutes then 
washed in a solution of sodium hypo- 
sulphite, after which they must be rinsed 
in clean water. 

Hi _Thirty parts of verdigris; 30 parts 
of sea salt; 30 parts of hematite; 30 parts 
of sal ammoniac, and 5 parts of alum. 
This must be all ground up together and 
mixed with strong vinegar; or we may 
also use 100 parts of verdigris; 100 parts 
of hydrochlorate of ammonia; 65 parts 
of saltpeter, and 40 parts of copper 
filings, all of which are to be well mixed 
with strong vinegar. 

22-Carat Solder.— Soldering is a proc- 
ess which, by means of a more fusible 
compound, the connecting surfaces of 
metals are firmly secured to each other, 
but, for many practical purposes, it is 
advisable to have the fusing point of the 
metal and solder as near each other as 
possible, which, in the majority of cases, 
preserves a union more lasting, and the 
joint less distinguishable, in consequence 
of the similarity of the metal and solder 
in color, which age does not destroy, and 
this is not the case with solders the fusible 
points of which are very low. The 
metal to be soldered together must have 
an afEnity for the solder, otherwise the 
union will be imperfect; and the solder 
should likewise act upon the metal, 
partly by this affinity or chemical attrac- 
tion, and partly by cohesive force, to 
unite the connections soundly and firmly 
together. Solders should therefore be 
prepared suitable to the work in hand, if 
a good and lasting job is to be made. It 
should alwavs be borne in mind that the 
higher the fusing point of the gold alloy 
—and this can be made to vary consid- 
erably, even with any specified quality— 
the harder solder must be used, tor. >a 
the case of a more fusible mixture of gold, 
the latter would melt before the solder 



and cause the work to be destroyed. A 
very good formula for the first, or ordi- 
nary, 22-carat alloy is this;

This mixture will answer all the many 

Eurposes of the jobber; for soldering 
igh quality gold wares that come for 
repairs, particularly wedding rings, it 
will be found admirably suited. If an 
easier solder is wanted, and such is very 
often the case with jobbing jewelers, es- 

Eccially where several solderings have to 
e accomplished, it is as well to have at 
hand a solder whicih will not disturb the 
previous soldering places, for if this is 
not prevented a very simple job is made 
very difficult, and a lot of time and 
patience wholly wasted. To guard 
against a thing of this kind the following 
solder may be employed on the top of 
the previous one:

Fine silver 0 3

This solder is of the same value as the 
previous one, but its melting point is 
lower, and it will be found useful for 
many purposes that can be turned to 
good account in a jobbing jeweler s 
business.

Soldering a Jeweled Ring. — In order 
to prevent the bursting of the jewels of a 
ring while the latter is being soldered, 
cut a juicy potato into halves and make 
a hollow in both portions in which the 
part of the ring having jewels may fit 
exactly. Wrap the jeweled portion in 
soft paper, place it in the hollow, and 
bind up the closed potato with binding 
wire. Now solder with easy-flowing 
gold solder, the potato being held in the 
band. Another method is to fill a small 
crucible with wet sand, bury the jeweled 
portion in the sand, and solder in the 
usual way.

oils artificial oil of mirbane, etc., but 
none of them seems entirely satisfactory. 
The addition of amyl acetate m the pro- 
portion of 10 grams to the liter (1 per 
Lnt) has also been suggested, severa 
experimenters reporting very successful 
results therefrom. Some years ago JJer- 
foger proposed a process for . removing 
sulphur compounds from benzine which 
would presumably be equally applicable 
to kerosene. This process is as follows: 

Potassium permanga- 
nate 1 ounce 

Sulphuric acid - 5 P mt 

Water S J pints 

Mix the acid and water, and when the 
mixture has become cold pour it into a 
2-gallon bottle. Add the permanganate 
and agitate until it is dissolved. Then 
add benzine, 1 gallon, and thoroughly 
agitate. Allow the liquids to remain m 
contact for 24 hours, frequently agitating 
the mixture. Separate the benzine and 
wash in a similar bottle with a mixture 
of 

Potassium permanga- 
nate 1 ounce 

Caustic soda jounce 

Water 2 pints 

Agitate the mixture frequently during 
several hours; then separate the benzine 
and wash it thoroughly with water. On 
agitating the benzine with the acid per- 
manganate solution an emulsion-like 
mixture is produced, which separates in 
a lew seconds, the permanganate slowly 
subsiding and showing considerable re- 
duction. In the above process it is 
quite probable that the time specified (24 
hours) is greatly in excess of what is 
necessary, as the reduction takes place 
almost entirely in a very short time. It 
has also been suggested that if the proc- 
ess were adopted on a manufacturing 
scale, with mechanical agitation, the 
time could be reduced to an hour or two.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING

lacquer be sure to stir long and thor

sTif up the batch before you begin to fill 
the small cans. , . 

The Brushing Lacquers can be sold to 
all of the dealers in your vicinity it you 
desire, or you can have agents out to 
sell them direct to the consumer. 

The furniture Lacquer formulas can 
be sold for all purposes where a spray- 
ing lacquer is required. Furniture fac- 
tories, or where woodwork is built and 
finished Lacquers are often used. 

To make a colored spraying lacquer 
simply add the colors to the spraying 
lacquers instead of to the clear Brush- 
ing Lacquer. For spraying you will 
probably need to add about one ounce 
more black, 2 ounces more yellow, 2 
ounces more red, 2 ounces green, 4 
ounces more white and 2 ounces more 
blue to the gallon of clear than you 
would to a gallon of Brushing Clear 
Lacquer. In others increase the amount 
of each color as given above so that 
when adding Black Ground Color to the 
furniture Lacquer you will have three 
ounces instead of two ounces. Spraying 
Lacquers require a little more pigment 
to the gallon to get coverage.

H 0W TO DECORATE FURNI- 
TURE NOVELTIES. 

In the past, home decorating has been 
nS jdered a more or less exclusive art but 
.. hoS n ow become almost, commonplace. 

Women who never have indulged in 
this form of fascinating work have still 
to find out what pleasure it will bring to 

th Those who like to feel that they are 
actually creating something can do no 
better than to purchase the necessary 
items with which to accomplish this work 
and then get busy. 

It is nut only economical to purchase 
these pieces of underrated furniture and 
then decorate them yourself but it is 
really a pleasure and will not seem at all 
like work to you. And I am sure that 
once you have" finished a piece of furni- 
ture or a novelty and can look upon it 
and perhaps even scrutinize it for de- 
fective %vorkmanship you will be sur- 
prised at its beauty. The desire to con- 
tinue on will at once take place and you 
will then proceed to finish up odd pieces 
such as bookshelfs, magazine stands, etc. 

You will find it not only a pleasure to 
do this work, if I may term it that, but 
you will also realize that it is highly 
educational. Who can doubt that when 
you mix your own shades in order to 
create the special color you desire but 
never could find, but that this is in 
itself educational. It will certainly be a 
pleasure to experiment and work out 
your own color schemes and obtain 
shades that you have long desired to have. 

There are of course a few rules that 
can be followed in planning and doing 
this work, 

In the first place you can get most of 
the items you wish to have in nearly all 
department stores and at present this 
line of endeavor has become so popular 
that gift shops, paint stores, etc., are 
also stocking up on the necessary mate- 
rials. 

There unpainted furniture is obtain- 
able in the assembled form or it can be 
purchased in knock-down form. It is 
just as well to buy it knock-down as it 
is somewhat cheaper and so easy is it put 
together that a small child could do ft. 

The necessary finishing materials can 
usually be obtained in the same store 
where the furniture is purchased. You 
will probably wish to have your pieces 
finished in the well known lacquer finish. 
Therefore you will ask the clerk to show 
you the colors carried in stock, also the 
amount of lacquer required to finish up 



your pieces. Be sure to obtain a small 
can of Reducer with the Brushing Lac- 
quer for when the lacquer gets thick and 
does not brush easily you will need to 
thin it out with this reducer. 

In addition to the brushing lacquer 
you will require a very soft brush with 
which to appy the lacquer, No doubt 
the clerk will recommend a camel's hair 
brush or at least one that is very soft. 

If you intend to stripe the furniture 
or the object that is to be finished it will 
also be necessary to obtain a tube or two 
of Japan or Oil colors together with a 
small striping brush. These striping 
brushes run in various sizes, depending 
upon the size of stripe you must have. 

If you expect to put a design on the 
pieces such as a painted flower or so, 
you will do well to purchase a decalco- 
mania transfer. These transfers come 
in a very large variety of patterns and 
sizes and range in prices of from five 
cents each up to a dollar. The clerk 
will probably give you instructions and 
material with which to put these on but 
in case you do not get the exact instruc- 
tions and the material, purchase a very 
small bottle or can of white damar var- 
nish and use this as the sticking medium 
with which to put on the decalcomania 
transfer. 

You are now armed with the materials 
necessary to finish furniture novelties 
and can proceed to finish the furniture. 

The first thing you do is to apply a 
coat of the brushing lacquer. When ap- 
plying this always flow it on. That is; 
fill your brush full of material and 
spread it out but do not work back and 
forth as you do when using a house 
paint. This is important. 

When applying lacquer it is opera- 
tive that you work fast as the lacquer 
dries very rapidly and if you do not 
brush on the material as fast as you can 
your work will be full of runs and 

Str Wmle' applying the material it is a 

that the material cannot run up or down.

therefore when using an orange, ycliow 
or a plain ^hite lacquer enamel it is 
necessfry to apply more coats to get the 

^ce'th^wk has been lacquered it 
is now ready to be striped. Practice 
on some odd panels before you attempt 
to apply the stripe on the furniture you 
are finishing because it takes a little ex- 
perience for one to draw a smooth, 
straight line. A good eye, a steady 
hand and continuous practice are the 
things that make one a good striper. 

After you have striped the work you 
can put on one or more decalcomanias, 
depending upon the kind of furniture 
you are finishing. "We advised above, 
how to apply these., with the use of white 
damar varnish. However in all proba- 
bilities you will be able to get good in- 
structions for putting these on at the 
store where they are purchased. 

Decalcomanias are very popular as 
they are much cheaper to apply than it 
would he to have the work painted by 
an artist. Furthermore it is now pos- 
sible to obtain beautiful transfers, where 
flowers and other work done by na- 
tionally known artists have been re- 
produced,

rule these enamels are applied with a 
spray gun since they do not brush well 
owing to their high viscosity.

The Furniture Lacquer No. 1 is 
the heavy bodied lacquer and this fur- 
Sa is for a lacquer ready to spread. 
No thinning is usually required for 
fitter No. 1 or No. 2. Both Lacquers 
Se excellent for spray work on furni- 
ture, level out well, give good full body, 
S pray nice and will rub good. 

UNIVERSAL THINNERS. 

As a general rule Lacquer Manufac- 
turers supply lacquers to the factories 
and consumers in a consistency that 
makes them ready for brushing or spray- 
ing without reducing or thinning them. 
However sometimes enamels are supplied 
rather thick and before they can be 
brushed or sprayed or applied in any 
way they must be thinned down with a 
thinner. A thinner is a liquid consisting 
of about the same solvents that go into 
the making of the lacquer or lacquer 
enamel. This is especially true if the 
same manufacturer who supplies the lac- 
quer supplies the thinner. However, 
there are many consumers who use a 
lacquer made by one company and a 
thinner by another and get good results 
even though the composition of both be 
somewhat different. Because of this we 
are listing a number of formulas for 
making thinners which can be called Uni- 
versal Thinners in that most of them 
will work with any Lacquer Product on 
the market. Starting with No. 1 we list 
six formulas the first one being the low- 
est grade and No. 6 being the highest 
grade. No. 1 will answer purposes for 
most uses but in hot, sultry weather 
when there is a great amount of humid- 
ity in the air, the applied film may suck 
in some of this moisture and on such 
days we suggest the use of a higher 
grade thinner than No. 1. The higher 
tha grade the less chance for a film 
brushing in humid weather. These thin- 
ners are not to be used for thinning 
Brushing Lacquers. Use the special 
Brushing Lacquer Thinner formulas. 
The formulas are written and must be 
formulated by the percentage method 
as for instance in No. 1. 14% Butyl 
I Acetate, 5% Ethyl Alcohol, etc.

The uce for a cleaning thinner is quite 
common in factories for washing lacquer 
and colors from the hands and for 
cleaning brushes and spray guns, etc. 
This must be a cheap product and still 
one which works well. The one we list 
herewith is very simple but it works 
very well. 

Ethyl Acetate, '' 65% 
V.M.P. Naptha, 35% 

There are any number of Thinners 
used for Brushing Lacquers but we list 
herewith two prominent ones which will 
serve to reduce most any grade of 
Brushing Lacquer satisfactorily.

Butyl Propionate 10% 

Butyl Acetate 5% 20% 

Butanol 15% 6%

GOLD PAINTS, BRONZING LIQ- 
UIDS. 

A Bronzing Liquid is a conveying so- 
lution which carries in it aluminum or 
copper powders which are used as coat- 
ings for chandeliers, novelties, picture 
frames, etc. These liquids must not con- 
tain free acid because the acid causes 
the bronze to turn green and the solution 
to gelatinize. Usually a very high vis- 
cosity cotton (commonly called nitrocel- 
lulose) is used as the basic solid and 
sometimes additional gum or resm is in- 
corporated into the solution. Special 
cotton for this purpose is ^ 
and sold by the nitrators. Also a thick 
solution is considered most desirable for 
trildinjr or bronzing objects as it gives 
I tool thick film, which, deposited over 

tective coating. In cases w . 
ic not thick enough an additional coai 
of the clear bronzing liquid can be ap- 

heavy to .f h ru * i8 or ^P t r S a l. The formula

tion after it is thoroughly dissolved into 
the cotton solution after that is all dis- 
solved. Then add the denatured alcohol 
slowly. Last add the Butyl Alcohol. 
"Where the formula calls for no gum or

cotton is dissolved thoroughly in the 
Butyl, Ethyl and Amyl Acetates. Then 
the Butyl Alcohol added and last of 
all the Toluol is SLOWLY added al-

AUTOMOBILE LACQUERS- 
BLACK AND COLORS. 

It would be impossible to list a for-

By making up this above formula and 
leaving out the Black and Blue Pigment 
colors you will get a clear lacquer solu- 
tion. Into this solution you can add 
ground colors or grind them in with the 
mill yourself, to obtain any shade de- 
sired. To know the approximate pro- 
portions of the colors needed to make 
various enamels, use the scale given un- 
der the headings ''Brushing Lacquers." 
Since auto lacquers are to be sprayed 
on and not applied with a brush a slight 
increase in the amount of pigments can 
be made because a denser covering prod- 
uct is necessary. Also, because this for- 
mula given herewith contains much more 
solid matter than the clear brushing lac- 
quer formulas, it will carry more pig- 
ment per gallon. 

STOCK DAMAR GUM SOLUTION. 

Dissolve 2% lbs. of Damar Gum in the 
following mixture of solvents, P/s V il r 
Benzol, % pint Ethyl Acetate, % pPl 
Acetone. After this' has been stirred, 
and allowed to dissolve completely l|s

there is 3 pounds of solid Damar. 
if your formula calls for 1% P°7U 
Damar Gum you would put in a ,3 qq&

put in a quart of Ester Gum Solution. 

PYROXYLIN CEMENTS. 

For mending leather belting and other 
such products the following Cement will 
serve very well. Usually the products 
consists of an 8 ounce cotton solution in 
various solvent mixtures.

Butyl Acetate solutions are also being 
used today and it is claimed that they 
give a better product than the one given 
above. Camphor can be used to make up 
a flexible Collodion product. Three 
ounces or less can be used to each gallon 
of finished product. 

AIRPLANE DOPE AND FIN- 
ISHES. 

Various formulas are used by dif- 
ferent manufacturers of airplane dopes 
and there is some difference of opinion 
as to which is the best formula. We will 
give herewith two accepted ones. 

U. S. Patent No. 1, 320, 458 (this for- 
mula is patented). 

Nitrated Cotton (high 

viscosity) 8 ounces 

Ethyl Acetate 30% 

Diaeetane Alcohol 4% 

Butanol 16% 

Benzol 50% 

Boiled Bapeseed Oil .... 16 ounces 

The eight ounces of cotton are mixed 
with a gallon of the above solvents and 
rapeseed oil is then added. 

Heavy Bodied Dope 

High Viscosity Cotton, . . 8 ounces 
Low Viscosity Cotton (% 

second) 26 ounces 

Ethyl Acetate 25% 

Denatured Alcohol 12%% 

Butyl Acetate 12%% 

Benzol 25% 

Toluol 25% 

Castor Oil 4 ounces 



The cotton is dissolved into the Ace- 
tates and when thoroughly dissolved the 
alcohols are added slowly. Then the 
Benzol and Toluol are added very, very 
slowly, stirring rapidly to avoid a pre- 
cipitation of the cotton and after it is 
all into solution Castor oil is added. 

GOLD LACQUERS. 

Liquid Bottle Lac— Into a half -gallon 
bottle put 8 ounces of shellac, and pour 
over it 1% pints of alcohol of 94 per cent, 
and 2% ounces of sulphuric ether. Let 
stand, with occasional shaking, until the 
Shellac is melted, and then add 4 ounces 
of thick turpentine and y 2 ounce of boric 
acid. Shake until dissolved. To color, 
use the aniline colors soluble in alcohol — 
for red, eosine; blue, phenol blue; black, 
negrosin; green, aniline green; violet, 
methyl violet, etc. If it is desired to have 
the lac opaque, add 8 ounces of pulverized 
steatite, but remember to keep the lac 
constantly stirred while using, as other- 
wise the steatite falls to the bottom. 

Lithographic Lacquer. — Dissolve IE 
parts, by weight, of red lithol R or G in 
paste of 17 per cent, in 350 parts, by 
weight, of hot water. Boil for 2 minutes, 
shaking with 2.5 parts, by weight, of 
barium chloride. Dissolve in 25 parts, 
by weight, of water. Add to the mixture 
100 parts, by weight, of aluminum hy- 
drate of about 4 per cent. Cool, filter, 
and dry. 

Lacquer for Microscopes, Mathemat- 
ical Instruments, etc.— Pulverize 160 
parts, by weight, turmeric root, cover it 
with 1,700 parts alcohol, digest in a warm 
place for 24 hours, and then filter. Dis- 
solve 80 parts dragon's blood, 80 parts 
sandarac, 80 parts gum elemi, 50 parts 
gum gutta, and 70 parts seed lac, put in 
a retort with 250 parts powdered glass, 
pour over them the colored alcohol first 
made, and hasten solution by warming in 
the sand or water bath. When complete- 
ly dissolved, filter. 

To Fix Alcoholic Lacquers on Metal- 
lic Waces,— Dissolve 0.5 parts of crys- 
ulefbo'radc acid in 100 
respective spirit varnish whereby the lat- 
LTafter be^ng applied forms so hard a 
coatine upon a smooth tin surface that 
■ t Sot be scratched off even with the 
finger-nails. The aforementioned per- 
eerltaee of boracic acid should not be 
exceeded in preparing the solution } other- 
wise the varnish will lose in intensity of 
color.

capsules are next placed in a well draw

Allow the capsules to cool for a few days 
before opening them, as the soot dries 
very slowly, and easily ignites again as 
Soon as air is admitted if the capsules 
are opened before. This is semi-calcined 
lampblack. 

For the purpose of preparing com-

For the manufacture of coal soot an- 
other furnace is employed. Asphalt or 
pitch is burned in it with exclusion of 
air as far as practicable. It is thrown 
in through the doors, and the smoke 
escapes through the chimney to the soot 
chambers, 1, 2, 3, i, and 5, assorting it- 
self there. 

When the amount of asphalt pitch des- 
tined for combustion has burned up com-

For advertising purposes the bulbs are 
often colored in two or more colors. It 
is also easy with a little practice to punt 
words or pictures, etc., on the bulbs with

Laundry Preparations 

BLUING COMPOUNDS: 

Laundry Blue, — The soluble blue of 
commerce, when properly made, dis- 
solves freely in water, and solutions so 
made are put up as liquid laundry blue. 
The water employed m making the solu- 
tion should be free from mineral sub- 
stances, especially lime, or precipitation 
ma y occur. If rain water or distilled 
water and a good article of blue be used, 
a staple preparation ought apparently to 
result; but whether time alone affects 
the matter of solubility it is impossible 
to state. As it is essential that the solu- 
tion should be a perfect one, it is best to 
filter it through several thicknesses of 
fine cotton cloth before bottling; or if 
made in large quantities this method 
may be modified by allowing it to stand 
some days to settle, when the top portion 
can be siphoned off for use, the bottom 
only requiring filtration. 

This soluble blue is said to be potas- 
sium ferri-ferrocyanide, and is prepared 
by gradually adding to a boiling solution 
of potassium ferricyanide (red prussiate 
of potash) an equivalent quantity of hot 
solution of ferrous sulphate, boiling for 
2 hours and washing the precipitate on a 
filter until the washings assume a dark- 
blue color; the moist precipitate can then 
at once be dissolved by the further ad- 
dition of a sufficient quantity of water. 
About 64 parts of the iron salt are neces- 
sary to eon vert 100 parts of the potassium 
salt into the blue compound. 

Leaf bluing for laundry use may be 
prepared by coating thick sized paper 
with soluble blue formed into a paste 
with a mixture of dextrin mucilage and 
glycerine. Dissolve a given quantity 
of dextrine in water enough to make a 
solution about as dense as ordinary 
syrup, add about as much glycerine as 
there was dextrine, rub the Tblue smooth 
with a sufficient quantity of this vehicle 
and coat the sheets with the paint. The 
amount of blue to be used will depend 
of course an the intended cost or the 
product, and the amount of glycerine will 
require adjustment so as to give a mixture 
which will not "smear" after the water 
has dried out and yet remain readily sol- 
uble. 

Ultramarine is now very generally used 
as a laundry blue where the insoluble or 
"bag blue" is desired. It is mixed with 
glucose, or glucose and dextrine, and 



pressed into balls or cakes. When glu- 
cose alone is used, the product has a 
tendency, it is said, to become soft on 
keeping, which tendency may be coun- 
teracted by a proper proportion of dex- 
tnn - (( Bmarbonate of sodium is added 
as a "filler" to cheapen the product, the 
quantity used and the quality of the 
ultramarine employed being both regu- 
lated by the price at which the product 
is to sell. 

The coal-tar or aniline blues are not 
offered to the general public as laundry 
blues, but laundry proprietors have 
them frecjuently brought under their 
notice, chiefly in the form of solutions, 
usually 1 to 1£ per cent strong. These 
dyes are strong bluing materials, and, 
being in the form of solution, are not 
liable to speck the clothes. Naturally 
their properties depend upon the par- 
ticular dye used; some are fast to acids 
and alkalies, others are fast to one but 
not to another; some will not stand iron- 
ing, while others again are not affected 
by the operation; generally they are not 
fast to light, but this is only of minor im 
portance. The soluble, or cotton, blue- 
are those most favored; these are made 
in a great variety of tints, varying from a 
reddish blue to a pure blue in hue, dis- 
tinguished by such brands as 3K, GB, 
etc. Occasionally the methyl violets 
are used, especially the blue tints. 
Blackley blue is very largely used for this 
purpose, being rather faster than th 
soluble blues. It may be mentjone 
that a 1 per cent solution of this dye ; 
usually strong enough. Unless care i_ 
taken in dissolving these dyes they are 
apt to produce specks. The heat to 
which the pure blues are exposed m iron- 
ing the clothes causes some kinds to 
assume a purple tinge. 

The cheapest aniline blue costs about 
three times as much as soluble blue, yet 
the tinctorial power of the aniline colors 
is so great that possibly they might be 
cheapened.

II —Make ordinary Prussian blue 
(that which has been purified by acids 
chlorine, or the hypochlorites) into a 
thick paste with distilled or ram water, 
and add a saturated solution of oxalic 
acid sufficient to dissolve. If time be ot 
no consequence, by leaving this solution 
exposed to the atmosphere, m the course 
of 60 days the blue will be entirely pre- 
cipitated in soluble form. Wash with 
weak alcohol and dry at about 100° i. 
The resultant mass dissolves in pure 
water and remains in solution indefi- 
nitely. It gives a deep, brilliant blue, 
and is not injurious to the clothing or 
the hands of the washwoman. 

The same result may be obtained by 
precipitating the soluble blue from its 
oxide solution by the addition of alcohol 
of 95 per cent, or with a concentrated solu- 
tion of sodium sulphate. Pour off the 
mother liquid and wash with very dilute 
alcohol; or throw on a filter and wash 
with water until the latter begins to come 
off colored a deep blue. 

Liquid Laundry Blue.— This may be 
prepared either with liquid Prussian blue 
or indigo carmine. Make a solution of 
gum dragon (gum tragacanth) by dis- 
solving 1 to 2 ounces of the powdered 
gum m 1 gallon of cold water in which 1 
ounce oxalic acid has been dissolved!

of yellow prussiate of potash (ferrucva 
nide of potassium) with water, and ifi e "

enough to be precipitated. 

Ball Blue.— The ball sold for laundry 
use consists usually, if not always, 0 f 
ultramarine. The balls are formed by 
compression, starch or some other ex- 
cipient of like character being added to 
render the mass cohesive. Blocks of 
blue can, of course, be made by the same 
process. The manufacturers of ultra- 
marine prepare balls and cubes of the 
pigment on a large scale, and it does 
not seem likely that there would be a 
sufficient margin of profit to justify the 
making of them in a small way "from 
the powdered pigment. Careful experi- 
ments, however, would be necessary to 
determine this positively. _ Ultramarine 
is of many qualities, and it may be ex- 
pected that the balls will vary also in the 
amount of "filling" according to the 
price at which they are to be sold. 
Below is a "filled" formula: 

Ultramarine 6 ounces 

Sodium carbonate 4 ounces 

Glucose 1 ounce 

Water, a sufficient quantity. 
Make a thick paste, roll into sheets, 
and cut into tablets. The balls in bulk 
can be obtained only in large packages 
of the manufacturers, say barrels of w» 
pounds; but put up in 1- pound boxes 
they can be bought in cases as small as it 
pounds.

V. — A good powder can be mad 
from 100 parts of crystal soda, 25 parts 
of dark-yellow rosin-cured soap, and 5 
parts of soft soap. The two latter are 
placed in a pan, along with one-half the 
soda (the curd soap being cut into small 
lumps), and slowly heated, with con- 
tinual crutching, until they are thorough- 
ly melted — without, however, beginning 
to boil. The fire is then drawn and the 
remaining soda erutched in until it, too, 
is melted, this being effected by the resid- 
ual heat of the mass and the pan. The 
mass will be fairly thick by the time the 
soda is all absorbed. After leaving a 
little longer, with occasional stirring, the 
contents are spread out on several thin 
sheets of iron m a cool room, to be then 
turned over by the shovel at short in- 
tervals, in order to further cool and break 
down the mixture. The soap will then 
be in a friable condition, and can be 
rubbed through the sieve, the best re- 
sults being obtained bv passing through 
a coarse sieve first, and one of finer mesh 
afterwards. With these

vessels, such as pails, barrels, etc., often 
become so dry that the joints do not 
meet, thus causing leakage. In order to 
obviate this evil stir together 60 parts 
hog's lard, 40 parts salt, and S3 parts 
wax and allow the mixture to dissolve 
slowly over a fire. Then add 40 parts 
charcoal to the liquid mass. The leaks 
in the vessels are dried oil well and hJled 
up with putty while still warm. When 
the latter has become dry, the barrels, 
etc., will be perfectly tight. If any 
putty is left, keep in a dry place and 
heat it to be used again. 

Leather 

(See also Shoes.) 

Artificial Leather. — Pure Italian hemp 
is cut up hue; 1 part of this and \ part of 
coarse, cleaned wool are carded together 
and formed into wadding. This wad- 
ding is packed in linen and felted by 
treatment with hot acid vapors. The 
resulting felt is washed out, dried, and 
impregnated with a substance whose 
composition varies according to the 
leather to be produced. Thus, good 
sole leather, for instance, is produced 
according to a Danish patent, in the 
following manner: Mix together 50 parts 
of boiled linseed oil; 20 parts of colo- 
phony; 25 parts of French turpentine; 
10 parts of glycerine, and 10 parts of 
vegetable way, and heat over a water 
bath with some ammonia water. When 
the mass has become homogeneous, add 
25 parts of glue, soaked in water, as well 
as a casein solution, which latter is 
produced by dissolving 50 parts, by 
weight, of moist, freshly precipitated 
casein in \ saturated solution of 16 parts 
of borax and adding 10 parts of potas- 
sium bichromate, the last two also by 
weight. Finally, mineral dyestuffs as 
well as antiseptic substances may be 
added to the mass. The whole mixture 
is now boiled until it becomes sticky and 
the felt is impregnated with it Jay im- 
mersion. The impregnated felt is dried 
for 24- hours at an ordinary tempera- 
ture; next laid into a solution of alumi- 
num acetate and Gnally dried completely, 
dyed, and pressed between hot rollers. 

Black Dye for Tanned Leather. — This 
recipe takes the place of the ilbsmelling 
iron blacking, and is not injurious to the 
leather. Gallnuts, pulverized, 150 parts; 
vitriol, green or black, 10 parts; rock 
candy, 60 parts; alum, 15 parts; vinegar, 
250 parts; cooking salt, 20 parts. Dissolve 
with 4,000 parts of distilled water. 

Boil this solution slowly and the 



blacking is done. When it has cooled 
and settled, pour through linen, thus 
obtaining a pure, good leather blacking. 

Bronze Leather.— All sorts of skins— 
sheepskins, goatskins, coltskins, and 
light calfskins— are adapted for the 
preparation of bronze leather. In this 
preparation the advantage lies not only 
in the use of the faultless skins, but scari- 
fied skins and those of inferior quality 
may also be employed. The dressing 
of the previously tanned skin must be 
carried out with the greatest care, to pre- 
vent the appearance of spots and other 
faults. After tanning, the pelts are well 
washed, scraped, and dried. Then 
they arc bleached. For coloring, it is cus- 
tomary to employ methyl violet whic 1 
has previously been dissolved in ho 
water, taking 100 parts, by weight, o 
the aniline color to 8,000 parts, by weighs 
of water. If in the leather-drcssin 
establishment a line of steam piping b 
convenient, it is advisable to boil up a 1 
the coloring dyes, rather than simply t 
dissolve them; for in this way complet 
solution is effected. Where steam i 
used no special appliance is required fo 
boiling up the dyes, for this may tak 
place without inconvenience in th 
separate dye vats. A length of stea 
hose and a brass nozzle with a valve 
all that is needed. It may be as well t 
add here that the violet color for dyein 
may be made cheaper than as abov 
described. To 3,000 parts, by weight, 
of pretty strong logwood decoction add 
50 parts, by weight, of alum and 100 
parts, by weight, of methyl violet. This 
compound is almost as strong a:; the 
pure violet solution, and instead of 8,000 
parts, by weight, we now have 30,UUO 
parts, by weight, of color 

The color is applied and well worked 
in with a stiff brush, and the skins al- 
lowed to stand for a short time, sufficient 
to allow the dye to penetrate the pores 
when it is fulled. As for the shade of 
the bronze, it may be made redd sh, 
bluish or brownish, accord mg to taste.

h£ is particularly the case with the 
iile and red dyes. If, therefore, the 
Met be applied in very strong solutions, 
- e effect w5l be much the same as when 
e regular bronze color is employed. 
Bronze color on a brown ground is he 
ost beautiful of all, and is used o the 
latest advantage when it is desirable 
to cover up defects. Instead of warm 
dear water in such a case, use a decoc- 
ion oHogwood to which a small quan- 
! ty o [ alum has been added and thus, 
during the fulling, impart to the skms a 
proper basic tint, which may, by the ap- 
lication of a little violet or bronze color, 
e converted into a most brilliant bronze. 
By no means is it to be forgotten that too 
much coloring matter will never produce 
the desired results, for here, as with the 
other colors, too much will bring out a 
greenish tint, nor will the gloss turn out 
so beautiful and clear. Next rinse the 
skins well in clean water, and air them, 
after which they may be dried with arti- 
ficial heat. Ordinary as well as dam- 
aged skins which are not suitable for 
chevreaux (kid) and which it is desirable 
to provide with a very high polish, in 
order the more readily to conceal the 
defects in the grain, and other imperfec- 
tions, are, after the drying, coated with a 
mixture, compounded according to the 
following simple formula: Stir well 1 
pint of ox blood and 1 pint of unboiled 
milk in 10 quarts of water, and with a 
soft sponge apply this to the surface oif 
the skin, The blood has no damaging 
effect upon the color. Skins thus mois- 
tened must not be laid one upon another, 
but must be placed separately in a thor- 
oughly well-warmed chamber to dry. 
When dry they are glossed, and may then 
be pressed into shagreen or pebbled. 
The thin light goatskins are worked Into 
kid or chevreaux. Properly speaking,, 
they are only imitation chevreaux (kid) 
for although they are truly goatskins, 
Tinder the term chevreaux one under- 
stands on y such skins as have been

commonly pull the skins out of all shape. 
Brushing is intended only to give the 
flesh side more of a flaky appearance. 

During the second glossing care must 
be taken that the pressure is light, for 
the object is merely to bring the skin 
back into its proper shape, lost in the 
stretching; the glossing proper should 
have been accomplished during the first 
operation. 

Cracked Leather.— The badly cracked 
and fissured carriage iurfacc greets the 
painter on every hand. The following 
is the recipe for filling up and facing over 
such a surface: Finest pumice stone, 6 
parts; lampblack (in bulk), 1 part; com- 
mon roughstuff filler, 3 parts. Mix to 
stiff paste in good coach japan, 5 parts; 
hard drying rubbing varnish, 1 part. 
Thin to a brushing consistency with 
turpentine, and apply 1 coat per day. 
Put on 2 coats of this filler and then 2 
coats o," ordinary roughstuff. Rub with 
lump pumice stone and water. This 
process docs not equal burning off in. 
getting permanently rid of the cracks, 
but when the price of painting forbids 
burning off, it serves as an effective sub- 
stitute. Upon a job that is well cared 
for, and not subjected to toe exacting 
service, this filler will secrete the cracks 
and fissures for from 3 to £ months. 

DRESSINGS FOR LEATHER: 

For Carriage Tops. — I.— Here is an 
inexpensive and quickly prepared dress- 
ing for carriage tops or the like: Take 
2 parts of common glue; soak and liquefy 
it over a fire. Three parts of castile 
soap are then dissolved over a moderate 
heat. Of water, 120 parts are added 
to dissolve the soap and glue, after which 
an intimate mixture of the ingredients is

DYEING LEATHER. 

Eyeing W^tI^S 

organic substances, such as leather, do 
not readily adapt themse Jvjs to the 
staining process, because a full brusmui 
of dye liquor would give a much deeper 
collation than a half-exhausted brush 
would give. Consequently, to alter and 
to color leather by the staining process 
results in a patchy coloration oi the skin. 
In the dyeing operation a amc shallow 
trough, 4 to 6 inches deep, is used, into 
which the dye liquor is put, and to pro- 
duce the best results the contents of the 
trough are kept at a uniform tempera- 
ture by means of a heating apparatus 
beneath the trough, such as a gas jet or 
two, which readily allows of a heat being 
regulated. The skins to be dyed are 
spread out flat in the dye trough, one at a 
time, each skin remaining in the dye 
liquor the time prescribed by the recipe. 
The best coloration of the skin is pro- 
duced by using 3 dye troughs of the 
same dye liquor, each of different 
strength, the skin being put in the 
weakest liquor first, then passed into the 
second, and from there into the third dye 
iquor, where it is allowed to remain

TANNING LEATHER. 

Pickling Process. — Eitner and Stiazny 
have made a systematic series of experi- 
ments with mixtures of salt and vari- 
ous acids for pickling skins preparatory 



M^fc B: a Es P e "ment S with hydro- 
chloric add acetic and lactic acids 
showed that these offered no advantages 
over su phunc acid for use in picklin? 
the p lc kled pelts and the leatLr prfc 
duced from them being similar in Ap- 
pearance and quality. By varying the 
concentration of the pickle liquors, it was 
found that the amount of salt absorbed 
by the pelt from the pickle liquor was 
controlled by the concentration of the 
solution, 23 to 25 per cent of the total 
amount used being taken up by the pelt, 
and that the absorption capacity of the 
pelt for acid was limited. 

The goods pickled with the largest 
amount of acid possessed a more leathery 
feel and after drying were fuller and 
stretched much better than those in, 
which smaller amounts of acids were 
employed. Dried, pickled pieces, con- 
taining as much as 3 per cent of sulphuric 
acid, showed no deterioration or tender- 
ing of fiber. The pickled skins after 
chrome tanning still retained these 
characteristics. An analysis of the 
leather produced by tanning with sumac 
showed that no free acid was retained in 
the finished leather. An Australian 
pickled pelt was found to contain 19.5 
per cent of salt and 2.8 per cent of sul 
phuric acid. 

From a very large number of expen 
merits the following conclusions wer 
drawn: 1. That sulphuric acid is quit 
equal in efficiency to other acids for th 
purpose. 2. To a certain limit inereas 
ing softness is produced by increasing 
the quantity • of acid used. 3. *or 
naturally soft skins and when a leather 
not very soft is required the best result 
are obtained by using 22 pounds of salt, 
2.2 pounds of sulphuric acid, and 25 gal- 
lonsof water for 110 pounds of pe dt in th 
drum. 4. For material which is natural.

The hide, according to the thickness, is 
left in the tan from 5 to 10 days. Skins 
are finished in about 2 or 3 days The 
hide should be run in a drum for about/ 
hours before going into tan, and again 
after that process. In tanning hides ior 
robes, shaviug them down is a mam 
requisite for success, as it is impossible 
to get soft leather otherwise. After 
shaving put' back into the tan liquor 
again for a day or two and hang up to 
dry. When good and hard, shave again 
and lay away in moist sawdust and give a 
heavy coat of oil. When dry, apply a 
solution oE soft soap - , roll up and lay away 
in moist sawdust again. Ran the hides 
on a drum or wheel until thoroughly soft. 
The composition of the tan liquor may 
be changed considerably. If the brown- 
ish tinge of the japonica be objectionable, 
that article may be left out entirely. The 
japonica has the effect oE making the 
robe more able to resist water, as the 
alum and salt alone are readily soaked 
out by rain.

newing process for second or consecutive 
D acks, use 15 pounds vitriol and 200 
nounds salt, always keeping stock con- 
stantly in motion during time of proe _ 
essin". After processing, drain over 
night, then put in tan in agitated liquors, 
keeping the stock in motion during the 
whole time of tanning. Pack do w n over- 
night. Use 200 pounds dry leather to 
each mill in stuffing. 

For stuffing, use 3 gallons curriers' 
hard grease and 3 gallons American cod 
oil. Strike out from mill, on flesh. Set 
out on grain. Dry slowly. Trim and 
board, length and cross. _ The stock is 
then ready to cut. The time for soaking 
the hides may be reduced one-half by 
putting the stock into a rapidly revolving 
reel pit, with a good inflow of water, so 
that the dirty water washes over and runs 
off. After io hours in the soak, put the 
stock into a drum, and keep it tumbling 
5 hours. This produces soft stock. 

In liming, where the saving of the hair 
is no object, softer leather is obtainable 
by using 35 pounds sulphide of sodium 
with 60 pounds lime. Then, when the 
stock comes from the limes, the hair is 
dissolved and immediately washes off, 
and saves the labor of unhairing and 
caring for the hair, which in some cases 
does not pay. 

MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES : 

Russian Leather— This leather owes, 
its name to the country of its origin. LM 
skins used for its production are goat, 
large sheep, calfskin, and cow or steer 
hide. The preliminary operations or 
soaking, unhairing, and fleshing are done 
in the usual manner, and then the hides 
are permitted to swell in a mixture <HJ|g 
flour, oat flour, yeast, and salt. - ^ 
compound is made into a P a f s ^ e 
water, and is then thinned with si 
cient water to steep a hundred hides _ 
the mixture. The proportions ot 11 a 
dients used for this mixture are ^ 
pounds rye flour, 10 pounds oat Dou > 
little salt, and sufficient yeast to set 
fermentation. . . _ nn i- 

The hides are steeped in

fresh liquor of the same ingredients and 
proportions is made up The hides are 
EarSened and split and then steeped in 
fhp freshly made liquor for another 8 
Savs when they are sufficiently tanned. 

The hides are then cut down the 
middle (from head to tail) into sides, and 
Sured rinsed, and dried by dripping, 
! n d then passed on to the currier who 
sightly dampens the dry sides and puts 
Sem m a heap or folds them together 
for a couple of days to temper, and then 
impregnates them with a compound con- 
Sne of ! parts birch oil and $ parts seal 
oi This is applied on the flesh side for 
lisiit leather, and on the grain side also 
for heavy leather. The leather is then 
"set out," "whitened," and well boarded 
and dried before dyeing. 

\ decoction of sandalwood, alone or 
mixed with cochineal, is used for pro- 
ducing the Russian red color, and this 
dye liquor is applied several times, 
allowing each application to dry before 
applying the following one. A brush is 
used and the dye liquor is spread on the 
grain side. A solution of tin chloride is 
used in Russia as a mordant for the 
leather before laying on the dye. The 
dye liquor is prepared by boiling 18 
ounces of sandalwood in 13 pints of 
water for 1 hour, and then filtering the 
liquid and dissolving in the filtering 
fluid 1 ounce of prepared tartar and 
soda, which is then given an hours 
boiling and set aside for a few days be- 
fore use. 

After dyeing, the leather is again im- 
pregnated with the mixture of birch and 
seal oils (applied to the grain side on a 
piece of flannel) and when the dyed 
leather has dried, a thin smear of gum- 
diagon mucilage is given to the dyed side 
to protect the color from fading, while 
the flesh side is smeared with bark-tan 
juice and the dyed leather then grained 
for market. 

Toughening Leather. — Leather_ is 
toughened and also rendered impervious 
by impregnating with a solution of 1 part 
of caoutchouc or gutta-percha in 16 parts 
of benzene or other solvent, to which is 
added 10 parts of linseed oil. Wax and 
rosin may be added to thicken the solu- 
tion. 

Painting on Leather.— When the leath- 
er is finished in the tanneries it is at the 
same time provided with the necessary 
greasy particles to give it the required 
pliancy and prevent it from cracking. 
It is claimed that some tanners strive to 
obtain a greater weight thereby, thus 
reasing their profit, since a pound ot 



fat is only one-eighth as dear as a pound 
of leather. 

If such leather, so called kips, which 
are much used for carriage covers and 
knee caps, is to be prepared for painting 
purposes, it is above all necessary to 
close up the pores of the leather, so that 
the said fat particles cannot strike 
through. They would combine with 
the applied paint and prevent the latter 
from drying, as the grease consists main- 
ly of fish oil. For this reason an elastic 
spirit leather varnish is employed, which 
protects the succeeding paint coat suffi- 
ciently from the fat. 

For further treatment take a goo 
coach varnish to which \ of stand o' 
(linseed oil which has thickened b; 
standing) has been added and allow th 
mixture to stand for a few days. Wi 
this varnish grind the desired color 
thinning them only with turpentine oi 
Put on 2 coats. In this manner th 
most delicate colors may be applied t 
the leather, only it is needful to put o 
pale and delicate shades several time 
In some countries the legs or tops o 
boots are painted yellow, red, green, 
blue in this manner. Inferior leathe 
such as sheepskin and goat leath 
which is treated with alum by the tanne 
may likewise be provided with color in 
the manner stated. Subsequently it can 
be painted, gilded, or bronzed. 

Stains for Oak Leather .—I.— Apply 
an intimate mixture of 4 ounces of umber 
(burnt or raw); £ ounce of lampblack, 
and 17 fluidounces ox gall. 

II The moistened leather is primed 

with a solution of 1 part, by weight oi 
copper acetate in 60 parts of wa«* 
slicked out and then painted with solu- 
tion of yellow prussiate potash in feebly 
acid water.
