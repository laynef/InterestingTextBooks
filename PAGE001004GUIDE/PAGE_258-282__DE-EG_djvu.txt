Depilatories 

Depilatory Cream.— The depilatory 
cream largely used in New York hospi- 
tals for the removal of hair from the skin 
previous to operations: 

I. — Barium sulphide. ... 3 parts 

Starch 1 part 

Water, sufficient quantity. 

The mixed powders are to be mad* 
into a paste with water, and applied in a 
moderately thick layer to the parts to be 
denuded of hair, the excess of the latter 
having been previously trimmed off witl 
a pair of scissors. From time to time « 
small part of the surface should be ex- 
amined, and when it is seen that the 
hair can be removed, the mass sbouh 
be washed off. The barium sulphide 
should be quite fresh. It can be pre; 
pared by making barium sulphate am 
its own weight of charcoal into a pasti 
with linseed oil, rolling the paste into tH€ 
shape of a sausage, and placing it upon 
bright fire to incinerate. When it has 
ceald to burn, and is a white hot mas,, 
remove from the fire, cool, .ndpoW*

quantity, forming into a paste with warm 
water and applying to the surface to be 
deprived of hair. Allow to remain from 
I to 5 minutes, according to the nature 
of the hair and skin; it is not advisable 
to continue the application longer, than 
the last named period. Remove m ail 
cases at once when any caustic action is 
felt. After the removal of the paste, 
scrape the skin gently but firmly with a 
blunt-edged blade (a paper knife, for in- 
stance) until the loosened hair is re- 
moved. Then immediately wash the 
denuded surface well with warm water, 
and apply cold cream or some similar 
emollient as a dressing.

Apply with a brush on the affected

When the collodion plaster thus formed 
is pulled off, the hairs adhere to its inner 
surface. 

V- — Rosin sticks are intended for the 
removal of hairs and are made from colo- 
phony with an admixture of 10 per cent 
of yellow wax. The sticks are heated 
like a stick of scaling wax until soft or 
semi-liquid (142° F.). and lightly applied 
on the place from which the hair is to be 
removed, and the mass is allowed to cool. 
Ihese rosin sticks are said to give good 
satisfaction. 

DEPRESSION GARDEN (Chemical 
Flowers) : 

■ Put several pieces of soft porous coal 

m a dish or bowl then mix 
6 tablespoonfuls of salt 
6 tablespoonfuls of blueing 
6 tablespoonfuls of water 
1 tahlespoonful of ammonia water

ture above, drop on a few drops of 
curochrome solution or a few ft ttter ~ 
green or red ink or any vegctabK ° E 
which is used for coloring; dessp^i ye ' 

Shortly after the materials wY^ 
brought together, a coral like C ol!l 
growth soon begins to appear on t? 
pieces of coal, and this growth increasS 
as the days go by. ,c *bes 

To prevent the growth forming on ft 
edges of the bowl or dish, tub on a litti! 
vaseline and the growth will not extend 
beyond the vaseline. Ammonia water 
can be added to the dish every little 
while to produce more growth, of snow 
crystals. 

"The Depression Garden" looks like 
tiny islands in a lake, covered with ver- 
dure and snow. A few twigs of ever- 
green can be stuck on the lumps of coal, 
they will look like tiny trees and the 
effect is improved. 
DIAMOND TESTS: 

See also Gems and Jewelers' For- 
mulas. 

To Distinguish Genuine Diamonds.— 

If characters or marks of any kind aie 
drawn with an aluminum pencil on glass, 
porcelain, or any substance containing 
silex, the marks cannot be erased by 
rubbing, however energetic the friction, 
and even acids will not cause them to dis- 
appear entirely, unless the surface is en- 
tirely freed from greasy matter, which 
can be accomplished by rubbing with 
whiting and passing a moistened doth 
over the surface at the time of writing. 
So, in order to distinguish the true dia- 
mond from the false, it is necessary only 
to wipe the stone carefully and trace a 
line on it with an aluminum pencil, and 
then rub it briskl v with a moistened clotii. 
If the line continues visible, the stone is 
surely false. If, on the contrary, the stone 
is a true diamond, the line will disappear 
without leaving a trace, and without in- 
jury to the stone. . . .t p 

The common test for recognizing the 
diamond is the file, which does not art - 
though it readily attacks 
There arc other stones not a»ectec j 
the file, but they ^MS^i 
color and other effects by which tnc> 
readily distinguished. G„ m( J\ by 

This test should be ™^™f e J* 
others. From the following «w 
can select the most convenient. ^ f fl 

A piece of glass on which the eog . , 
diamond is drawn, will be cut £ ^ 
much pressure; a slight Dltn ^ n ; m ita- 
cient to separate the glass. ^ g w yl 
tion may scratch the glass, t>ui 
not be cut as with the diamond-

*B? poking through a diamond with a

g a single distinct point will be seen,

oearif the stone is spurious. 
P Hydrofluoric acid dissolves all lmita- 
4 ; n „s but has no effect on true diamonds. 
This' acid is kept in gutta-percha bot- 

'^For an eye practiced in comparisons 
it is not difficult to discern that the facets 
in the cut of a true diamond arc not as 
regular as are those of the imitation; for 
in cutting and polishing the real stone an 
effort is made to preserve the original as 
much as possible, preferring some slight 
irregularities in the planes and edges to 
the loss in the weight, for we all know 
that diamonds are sold by weight. In an 
imitation, however, whether of paste or 
another less valuable stone, there is al- 
ways an abundance of cheap material 
which may be cut away and thereby 
form a perfect-appearing stone. _ 

Take a piece of a fabric, striped red 
and white, and draw the stone to be 
tested over the colors. If it is an imi- 
tation, the colors will be seen through it, 
while a diamond will not allow them to 
be seen. 

A- genuine diamond, rubbed on wood 
or metal, after having been previously 
exposed to the light of the 

^hsch does not occur with imitations. 

Heat the stone to be tested, after giving 
«a coating of borax, and let it fall into

Form.aldeh.yde for Disinfecting ' 

Papers, etc.— The property of formL

even when folded together in severs 
layers, may be utilized for a perfect dis 
infection of books and letters, especially 
at a temperature of 8G° to 122° F. in 
closed room. The degree of penetrs 
lion as well as the disinfecting power

24 hours at a temperature of 122° 
when 70 cubic centimeters cf form( 
chloral— 17.5 g. of gas— per cubic mete

further use. This can be easdy avoided 
by coating them with collodion, to which 
24 per cent of stean'ne from a good stearine

all the implements used in dyeing be ken 
perfectly clean. Prepare the goods bv 
scouring well with soap and water wash" 
mg out the soap well, and dipping in warm 
water, before immersion in the dye or 
mordant. Goods should he well aired, 
rinsed, and properly hun^ up after dye- 
ing. Silks and fine goods should be ten- 
derly handled, otherwise injury to the 
fabric will result. 

Aniline Black. — Water, 20 to 30 parts; 
chlorate of potassa, 1 part; sal ammo- 
niac, 1 part; chloride of copper, 1 part; 
aniline and hydrochloric acid, each 1 part, 
previously mixed together. It is essen- 
tial that the preparation should be acid, 
and the more acid it is the more rapid 
will be the production of the blacks; ii 
too much so, it may injure the fabric. 
The fabric or yarn is dried in agnng 
rooms at a low temperature for 24 hours, 
and washed afterwards. 

Black on Cotton.— For 40 pounds 
goods, use sumac, 30 pounds; boil J ot an

Brown Dye for Wool— This may b 
induced by a decoction of oak bark, with 
variety of shade according to the quan- 
tity employed. If the goods be fir 
passed through a mordant of alum the 
color will be brightened.

Ltthe whole boil 20 minutes longer; 
then rinse and dry. If the aniline be 
added in 2 or 3 proportions during the 
process of coloring, it will facilitate the 
evenness of the color. 

Blue on Cotton.— For 40 pounds of 
goods, uae copperas, 2 pounds; boil and 
dip 20 minutes; dip in soapsuds, and 
return to the dye 3 or 4 times; then 
make a new bath with prussiate of pot-

Sky Blue on Cotton. — For 60 pounds 
of goods, hlue vitriol, 5 pounds. Boil a 
short time, then enter the goods, dip 3 
hours, and transfer to a bath of strong 
limewater. A fine brown color will be 
imparted to the goods if they are then 
put through a solution of prussiate of 
potash. 

Blue Dye for Hosiery. — One hundred 
pounds of wool are colored with 4 pounds 
Guatemala or 3 pounds Bengal indigo, 
in the soda or wood vat. Then boil in 
a kettle a few minutes, 5 pounds of cud- 
bear or 8 pounds of archil paste; add 1 
pound of soda, or, better, 1 pail of urine; 
then cool the dye to about 170° F. and 
enter the wool. Handle well for about 
20 minutes, then take it out, cool, rinse, 
and dry. It makes no difference 
whether the cudbear is put in before or 
after the indigo. Three ounces of ani- 
line purple dissolved in alcohol, i pint, 
can be used instead of the cudbear. 
Wood spirit is cheaper than alcohol, and 
is much used by dyers for the purpose of 
'dissolving aniline colors. It produces a 
very pretty shade, but should never be 
used on mixed goods which have to be 
bleached.

to remove sizing or stiffening; then rinse 
in warm water to get out the soap 
Scald cudbear, 1 ounce, m sufficient 
water to cover the hat; work it m this

obtained. Have a vessel of cold water, 
blued with the extract of indigo, \ ounce, 
and work or stir the bonnet m this until 
the tint pleases. Dry, then rinse out 
with cold water, and dry again in the 
shade. If the purple is too deep in shade 
the final slate will be too dark. 

Silver Gray for Straw.— For 35 hats, 
select the whitest hats and soften them 
in a bath of crystallized soda to which 
some clean limewater has been added. 
Boil for 2 hours in a large vessel, using 
for a bath a decoction of the follow- 
ing: Alum, 4 pounds; tartaric acid, \ 
Pound; some ammoniacal cochineal, 
a-nd carmine of indigo. A little sulphuric

grayish green is produced, which must 
be brightened" and fixed in a second bath 
of water 100° F., to which some acetic 
acid has been added. Cotton requires 
preparation by sumac. 

Green for Cotton.— For 40 pounds of 
goods, use fustic, 10 pounds; blue vitriol, 
10 ounces; soft soap, 2^ quarts; and log- 
wood chips, 1 pound 4 ounces. Soak 
the logwood overnight in a brass vessel, 
and put it on the fire in the morning, 
adding the other ingredients. When 
quite hot it is ready for dyeing; enter the 
goods at once, and handle well. Differ- 
ent shades may be obtained by letting 
part of the goods remain longer in the 
dye. 

Green for Silk. — Boil green ebony in

alum, 3 pounds; muriate of tin, 4 tea- 
cups; pulverized cochineal, 1 pound; 
cream of tartar, 2 pounds. Boil the 
alum, tin, and cream* of tartar for £0 
minutes, add the cochineal and boil 5 
minutes; immerse the goods 2 hours; re- 
move and enter them in a new dye com- 
posed of brazil wood, 8 pounds; log- 
wood, 7 pounds; alum, 4 pounds, and 
muriate of tin, 8 cupfuls, adding a little 
extract of indigo. 

Purple for Cotton. — Get up a tub of 
hot logwood liquor, enter 3 pieces, give 
them 5 ends, and hedge out. Enter 
them in a clean alum tub, give them 5 
ends, and hedge out. Get up_ another 
tub of logwood liquor, enter, give them 
5 ends, and hedge out; renew the alum 
tub, give 5 ends in that, and finish. 

Purple for Silk.— For 10 pounds of 
goods, enter the goods in a blue dye bath, 
and secure a light-blue color, dry, and 
dip in a warm solution containing alum, 
2| pounds. Should a deeper color be 
required, add a little extract of indigo. 

Solferino and Magenta for "Woolen, 
Silk, or Cotton. — For 1 pound of woolen 
goods, magenta shade, 90 grains, apothe- 
caries' weight, of aniline red, will be re- 
quired. Dissolve in a little warm alco- 
hol, using, say, G fluidounces, or about 6 

Sills alcohol per ounce of aniline. Many 
yers use wood spirits because of its 
cheapness. For a solferino shade, use 
64 grains aniline red, and dissolve in 4 
ounces alcohol, to each 1 pound of goods. 
^Cold water, 1 quart, will dissolve these 
'small quantities of aniline red, but the 
cleanest and quickest way will be found 
by using the alcohol, or wood spirits. 
Clean the cloth and goods by steeping 
at a gentle heat in weak soapsuds, rinse 
in several masses of clean water and lay 
aside moist. The alcoholic solution of 
aniline is to be added from time to time 
to the warm or hot dye bath, till the color 
on the goods is of the desired shade, 
■the goods are to be removed from the 
ave bath before each addition of the 
alcoholic solution, and the bath is to be 
well stirred before the goods are re- 
turned. The alcoholic solution should 
be brst dropped into a little water, and 
wen mixed and the mixture should then 
be strained into the dye bath. If the 
fZZ l L n ? 1 dark cn °i'ffh after working 
2 30 mi ^tes, repeat the re- 

moval ot the Roods from the bath, and 
the addjt.on of the solution, and the re- 

SSh of lhe eoods from 15 to 3 o 
mov^r ,°r until su ited, then re- 

move from the bath and rinse in several 



masses of clean water, and drv in *v

dye bath for 1 pound of goods; l es J 
for larger quantities. ' Ss Wat « 

Violet for Silk or Wool.-A good vi 0 l et 
dye may be given by passing the ff „«j 
first through a solution of verdigris tk 
through a decoction of logwood 2 
lastly through alum water. A fast'viX* 
may be given by dyeing the goods crim 
son with cochineal, without a l um 0 - 
tartar, and after rinsing passing them 
through the indigo vat. Linens or cot 
tons are first galled with 18 per cent of 
gallnuts, next passed through a mordant 
of alum, iron liquor, and sulphate of 
copper, working them well, then worked 
in a madder bath made with an equal 
weight of root, and lastly brightened 
with soap or soda. 

Violet for Straw Bonnets.— Take alum 
4 pounds; tartaric acid, 1 pound; chlor- 
ide of tin, 1 pound. Dissolve and boil, 
allowing the hats to remain in the boiling 
solution 2 hours; then add enough decoc- 
tion of logwood, carmine, and indigo to 
induce the desired shade, and rinse finally 
in water in which some alum has been dis- 
solved. 

Wine Color. — For 50 pounds of goods, 
use camwood, 10 pounds, and boil 20 
minutes; dip the goods A hour, boil again, 
and dip 40 minutes; then darken with 
blue vitriol, 15 ounces, and 5 pounds of 
copperas. 

Lilac for Silk. — For 5 pounds of silk, 
use archil, 7i pounds, and mix well 
with the liquor. Make it boil { hour, 
and dip the silk quickly; then let it cool, 
and wash in river water. A fine half 
violet, or lilac, more or less full, will be 
obtained. 

RED, CRIMSON, AM) PINK DYES: 

Aniline Red.— Inclose the aniline m 
a small muslin bag. Have a kettle (tin 
or brass ) tilled with moderately 'not

Wash and dry. 

Aniline Scarlet.— For every 40 pounds 
of goods, dissolve 5 pounds white vitriol 
(sulphate of zinc) at 180° F., place the 
goods in this bath for 10 minutes, then 
add the color, prepared by boiling fora 
few minutes, 1 pound aniline scarlet in 
3 gallons water, stirring the same con- 
tinually. This solution has to be fil- 
tered before being added to the bath. 
The goods remain in the latter for 15 
minutes, when they have become 
browned and must be boiled for another 
half hour in the same bath after the so- 
lution of sal ammoniac. The more of 
this is added the deeper will be the shade. 



Scarlet with Cochineal. — For 50 pounds 
of wool, yarn, or cloth, use cream of tar- 
tar, 1 pound 9 ounces; cochineal, pul- 
verized, 12i ounces; muriate of tin or 
scarlet spirit, 8 pounds. After boiling 
the dye, enter the goods, work them well

Muriate of Tin or Scarlet Spirit. - 
±ake 10 pounds muriatic acid, 22° Be ■ 
1 pound feathered tin, and water, 1 
pounds. The acid should be put in a 
stoneware pot, and the tin added, and 
allowed to dissolve. The mixture should 
be kept a few days before using. The 
tin is feathered or granulated by melting 
in a suitable vessel, and pouring it from 
a height of about 5 feet into a pailful of 
water. This is a most powerful agent 
in certain colors, such as scarlets, or- 
anges, pinks, etc. 

Pink for Cotton. — For 40 pounds of 
goods, use redwood, 20 pounds; muriate 
of tin, 9^ pounds. Boil the redwood 1 
hour, turn off into a large vessel, add the 
muriate of tin, and put in the goods. 
Let it stand 5 or 10 minutes, and a good 
fast pink will be produced. 

Pink for Wool. — For CO pounds of 
goods, take alum, 5 pounds 12 ounces; 
boil and immerse the goods 50 minutes; 
then add to the dye cochineal well pul- 
verized, 1 pound, 4 ounces; cream of 
tartar, 5 pounds; boil and enter the goods 
while boiling, until the color is satisfac- 
tory. 

YELLOW, ORANGE, AND BRONZE 

DYES: 

Aniline Yellow.— This color is slightly 
soluble in water, and for dyers use may 
be used directly for the preparation of 
the bath dye, but is best used by dis- 
solving 1 pound of dye in 2 gallon, alco- 
hol Temperature of bath should be 
under 200 F. The color is much im- 
proved and brightened by a trace of sub 
phuric acid.

goods, and dip for 2 hours, wring them 
out, make a fresh dye with bichromate 
of potash, 4 pounds; madder, 1 pound, 
and immerse until the desired color is 
secured. The shade may be varied by 
dipping in limewater. 

Bronze. — Sulphate or muriate of man- 
ganese dissolved in water with a little 
tartaric acid imparts a beautiful bronze 
tint. The stuff after being put through 
the solution must be turned through a 
weak lye of potash, and afterwards 
through another of chloride of lime, to 
brighten and fix it. 

Prussiate of copper gives a bronze or 
yellowish-brown color to silk. The piece 
well mordanted with blue vitriol may be 
passed through a solution of prussiate of 
potash. 

Mulberry for Silk. — For 6 pounds of 
silk, use alum, 1 pound 4 ounces; dip 50 
minutes, wash out, and make a dye with 
brazil wood, 5 ounces, and logwood, 1J 
ounces, bv boiling together. Dip in this 
\ hour; then add more brazil wood and 
logwood, equal parts, until the color 
suits. 

FEATHER DYES. 

T. — Cut some white curd soap in small 
pieces, pour boiling water on them, and 
add a little pearlash. When the soap is 
quite dissolved, and the mixture cool 
enough for the hand to bear, plunge the 
feathers into it, and draw them through 
the hand till the dirt appears squeezed 
out of them; pass them through a clean 
lather with some blue in it; then rinse 
them in cold water with blue to give them 
a good color. Beat them against the 
hand to shake off the water, and dry by 
shaking them near a fire. When perfect- 
ly dry coil each fiber separately with a 
blunt knife or ivory folder.

DYES FOR ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS. 

The French employ velvet, fine cam- 
bric, and kid for the petals, and taffeta 
for the leaves. Very recently thin plates 
of bleached whalebone have been used 
for some portions of the artificial flowers. 

Colors and Stains. — I. — Blue. — Indigo

Each set of hats, after being > exposed to 
the bath with occasional airings during 
40 minutes, is taken off the pegs, and laid 
out upon the ground to be more com-

ment of the iron with the atmospheric 
oxygen. In 3 or 4 hours the dyeing is 
completed. When fully dyed, the hats 
are well washed in running water. 

Straw hats or bonnets may be dyed 
black by boiling them 3 or 4 hours in a 
strong hquor of logwood, adding a little 
copperas occasionally. Let the bonnets

mordanting bath should be at a boiling 
heat, and the poods should also be placed 
in a warm bath of tannin, 90° F., for half 
an hour. In dyeing, a hot solution of 
the color must be used to which should 
be added, in the case of the cotton, some 
chloride of zinc, and, in the case of the 
wool, a certain amount of tannin solu- 
tion. 

To Render Aniline Colors Soluble in 
\y a t en _A solution of gelatin in acetic 
acid of almost the consistence of syrups 
is first made, and the aniline in fine is 
gradually added, stirring all the time so 
as to make a homogeneous paste. The 
mixture is then to be heated over a water 
bath to the temperature of boiling water 
and kept at that heat for some time. 

Limewater for Dyers' Use. — Put some 
lime, 1 pound, and strong limewater, 1$ 
pounds, into a pail of water; rummage 
well for 7 or 8 minutes. Then let it 
rest until the lime is precipitated and the 
water clear; add this quantity to a tubful 
of clear water. 

To Renew Old Silks. — Unravel and 
put them in a tub, cover with cold water, 
and let them remain 1 hour. Dip them 
up and down, but do not wring; hang up 
to drain, and iron while very damp. 

Fuller's Purifier for Cloths.— Dry,

DYES A WD DYESTUFFS. 

Prominent among natural dyestuffs is 
the coloring matter obtained from log- 
wood and known as "hsematein." The 
color-forming substance (or chromogen) 
hematoxylin, exists in the logwood 
partly free and partly as a glucoside. 
vvnen pure, hsematoxylin forms nearly 
colorless crystals, but on oxidation, es- 
pecially m the presence of an alkali, it 
u> converted into the coloring matter 
bjematein which forms colored lakes 
with metallic bases, yielding violets.

quercitron extracts, and with glucose or 
molasses. 

Fustic is the heart- wood of certain 
species of trees indigenous to the West 
Indies and tropical South America. It 
is sold as chips and extract, yields a 
coloring principle which forms lemon- 
yellow lakes with alumina and is chiefly 
used in dyeing wool. Young fustic is 
the heart-wood of a sumac native to the 
shores of the Mediterranean, which 
yields an orange-colored lake with alum- 
ina and tin salts. 

Cutch, or catechu, is obtained from 
the wood and pods of the Acacia catechu, 
and from the betel nut, both native in 
India. Cutch appears in commerce in 
dark-brown lumps, which form a dark- 
brown solution with water. It contains 
catechu-tan nic acid, as tannin and 
catechin, and is extensively used in 
weighting black silks, as a mordant for 
certain basic coal-tar dyes, as a brown 
dye on cotton, and for calico printing. 

Indigo, which is obtained from the 
glucoside indican existing in the indigo 
plant and in woad, is one of the oldest 
dyestuffs. It is obtained from the plant 
by a process of fermentation and oxida- 
tion. Indigo appears in commerce in 
dark-blue cubical cakes, varying very 
much in composition as they often con- 
tain indigo red and indigo brown, be- 
sides moisture, mineral matters, ana 
glutinous substances. Consequently en

*7 TtpH from aniline or its derivatives 
Korswere known as "aniline dyes," 
t i « a Iar"e number are now prepared 
& othe? Constituents of coal tar than 
Sne they are better called "coal-tar 
^stuffs " There are many schemes ot 
Location. Eenedikt-Knecht divides 
them into I, aniline or amine dyes; II, 
phenol dyes; III, azp dyes; IV, qumo- 
Kae and acridme derivatives; V, anthra- 
cene dyes; and VI, artificial indigo. _ _ 

Of the anthracene dyes, the alizarine is 
the most important, since this is the 
coloring principle of the madder. The 
synthesis of alizarine from anthracene 
was effected by Grabc and Liebermann 
in 1S68. This discovery produced a 
complete revolution in calico printing, 
turkey-red dyeing, and in the manu- 
facture of madder preparations. Madder 
finds to-day only a very limited applica- 
tion in the dyeing of wool. 

In textile dyeing and printing, sub- 
stances called mordants arc largely used, 
either to fix or to develop the color on 
tic fiber. Substances of mineral origin, 
such as salts of aluminum, chromium, 
iron, copper, antimony, and tin, prin- 
cipally, and many others to a less extent 
and of organic origin, like acetic, oxalic, 
citric, tartaric, and lactic aeid, sulpho- 
sated oils, and tannins are employed as 
mordants. 

Iron liquor, known as black liquor or 
PSiolignite of iron, is made by dissolving 
se rap hon in pyroligneous acid. It is 
Us ed as a mordant in dyeing silks and 
a P d m calico printing. 
Ked liquor is a solution of aluminum 
cetate in acetic acid, and is produced 
y acting on calcium or lead acetate solu- 
ons with aluminum sulphate or the

Non-Poisonous Textile and Egg Dy 
for Household Use.-The preparationo 
non-poisonous colors for dyeing fabric, 
and eggs at home constitutes a separaf 
department m the manufacture of dve 
stuffs. J 

Certain classes of aniline dyes may b 
properly said to form the materials. Th 
essence of this color preparation eonsis 1 
chiefly m diluting or weakening the coal 
tar dyes, made in the aniline factorie 
and bringing them down to a certai 
desired shade by the addition of certai 
chemicals suited to their varying chara 
teristics, which, though weakening the 
color, act at the same time as the so-called 
mordants. 

The anilines are divided with refer- 
ence to their characteristic reactions into 
groups of basic, acid, moderately acid, 
as well as dyes that are insoluble in 
water. 

In eases where combinations of one or 
more colors are needed, only dyes of 
similar reaction can be combined, that is, 
basic with basic, and acid with acid. 

For the purpose of reducing the 
original intensity of the colors, and also 
as mordants, dextrin, Glauber's salt, 
alum, or aluminum sulphate is pressed 
into service. Where Glauber's salt is 
used, the neutral salt is exclusively em- 
ployed, which can be had cheaply and m 
immense quantities in the chemical 
industry. Since it is customary to pacK 
the color mixtures in two paper boxes, 
one stuck into the other, and ^°J e | 
since certain coal-tar dyes are only used 
in large crystals, it is only reasonable ; that 
the mordants should be calcined and not 
out up in the shape of crystallized salts

Sanical mixing of basic coal -tar dye-

dine dyes tuffs, with dextrin m the ratio 
of about 1 P»rt of anil me dye to 8 parte 
of dextrin; under certain f^ u + m f^nce S 
according to the concentrated state of the 
dyes tLe reducing quantity of the dextrin 
Say be greatly increased.. As reducing 
agents for these colors insoluble sub- 
stances may also be employed. A part 
also of the egg dyes are treated with the 
neutral sulphate; for instance, light 
brilliant green, because of its rubbing off, 
is made with dextrin and Glauber s salt 
in the proportion of 1:3:3. 

For the dyeing of eggs such color mix- 
tures are preferably employed as contain 
along with the dye proper a fixing agent 
(dextrin) as well as a medium for the 
superficial mordanting of the eggshell. 
The colors will then be very brilliant. 

Here are some recipes:

Very little of these mixtures suffices for 
dyeing five eggs. The coloring matter is 
dissolved in 600 parts by weight of boil- 
ing water, while the eggs to be dyed are 
boiled hard, whereupon they are placed 
in the dye solution until they seem suffi- 
ciently colored. The dyes should be put 
up in waxed paper. 

Fast Stamping Color. — Rub up sepa- 
rately, 20 parts of cupric .sulphate and 20 
parts of anilic hydrochlorate, then mix 
carefully together, after adding 10 parts 
of dextrin. The mixture is next ground 
with 5 parts of glycerine and sufficient 
water until a thick, uniform, paste-like 
mass results, adapted for use by means 
of stencil and bristle-brush. Aniline 
black la formed thereby in and upon the 
liber, which is not destroyed by boiling. 

New Mordanting Process.— The or- 
dinary method of mordanting wool with 
a bichromate and a reducing agent al- 
ways makes the fiber more or less tender,

solution of sodium bisulphite A , a 
ing to a recent French patent b^tt 
results are obtamed with neutral or 33? 
ly basic chromium sulphocyanide TV 
salt, if neutral or only slightly basic win 
mordant wool at 148° F. The doubf 
sulphocyanide of chromium and ammo 
mum, got by dissolving chromic oxide in 
ammonium sulphocyanide, can also h 
used. Nevertheless, in order to precini 
tate chromium chromate on the liber 
it is advisable to have a soluble chromate 
and a nitrate present, as well as a soluble 
copper salt and a free acid. One ex- 
ample of the process is as follows: Make 
the bath with 2 to 3 per cent of ammonio- 
chromium sulphocyanide, one-half of 1 
per cent sodium bichromate, one-third of 
1 per cent sodium nitrite, one-third of 1 
per cent sulphate of copper, and 1.5 per 
cent sulphuric acid— percentages based 
on the weight of the wool. Enter cold 
and slowly heat to about 140° to 150° P. 
Then work for half an hour, lift and rinse. 
The bath does not exhaust and can ba 
reinforced and used again. 

Process for Dyeing in Khaki Colors.— 
Bichromate of potash or of soda, chloride 
of manganese, and a solution of acetate 
of soda or formiatc of soda (15° Be.) are 
dissolved successively in equal quan- 
tities. 

The solution thus composed of these 
three salts is afterwards diluted at will, 
according to the color desired, con- 
stituting a range from a dark brown to a 
light olive green shade. The propor- 
tions of the three salts may be increased 
or diminished, in order to obtain shades 
more or less bister. i 

Cotton freed from its impurities by the 
usual methods, then fulled as ordinarily, 
is immersed in the bath. After a period, 
varying according to the results desired, 
the cotton, threads, or fabrics of cotton, 
are washed thoroughly and plunged, sou 
wet, into an alkaline solution, of wwen 
the concentration ought never to he je 
than 14° Be. This degree of cow*nt» 
tion is necessary to take hold ot tae n

It is very important to precipitate the 
aluminum cold, and heat up before 
adding the dyestuff. The chemicals 
used for precipitating must be added 
very slowly and while constantly stirring. 
The quantity used for the three wash-

DYES, COLORS, ETC., FOR TEXTILE 
GOODS: 

Aniline Black.— This black is pro- 
duced bv carefully oxidizing aniline hy- 
drochloride. The exact stage of oxida- 
tion must be carefully regulated or the 
product will be a different body (qui- 
Done). There are several suitable oxi- 
dizing agents, such as chromic acid, 
potassic bichromate, ferrocyanide of 
potassium, etc., but one of the easiest to 
manipulate is potassic chlorate, which 
by reacting on copper sulphate pro- 
duces potassic sulphate and copper 
chlorate. This is easily decomposed, 
its solution giving off gases at _G0° F. 
which consist essentially of chloride an- 
hydrate. But one of the most useful 
agents for the production of aniline 
black is vanadate of ammonia, 1 part of 
which will do the work of 4,000 parts of 
copper. Many other salts besides cop- 
per may he used for producing aniline

The fabric is first put into the stannate 
of soda mordant for a few minutes, then 
wrung out and put into the alum mor- 
dant for about the same time;_ then it is 
again wrung out and entered in the dye 
bath at 120° F. and dyed to shade de- 
sired, and afterwards rinsed in cold 
water and dried. 

The dye bath is made of } ounce of 
rose bengal per gallon of water. If 
fast pink is the dye used, the mordant 
used would be Turkey red oil and red 
liquor. Use 8 ounces of Turkey red oil 
per gallon of water. Put the fabric into 
this, then wring out the textile and work 
in red liquor of 7° Tw. for about 2 hours, 
then wring out and^ dye in a separate 
bath made up of eosine, or fast pink, in 
water in which a little alum has been dis- 
solved. 



To Dye Woolen Yarns, etc., Various 



Shades of Magenta. — To prepare the dye 
bath dissolve 1 pound of roseine in 15 
gallons of water. For a concentrated 
solution use only 10 gallons of water, 
while if a very much concentrated color 
is needed, dissolve the dye in methylated 
spirit of wine, and dilute this spirituous 
tincture with an equal quantity of water. 

No mordant is required in using this 
color in dyeing woolen goods. The dye- 
ing operation consists simply in putting 
the goods into the dye bath at 190° F. 
and working them therein until the de- 
sired shade is obtained, then rinsing in 
cold water and drying. 

If the water used in preparing the dye 
is at all alkaline, make use of the acid 
roseine dissolved in water in which a 
little sulphuric acid has been mixed, and 
work, gradually raising to the boiling 
pointy and keep up the temperature for 
SO minutes, or according to the shade 
desired. Put about 20 per cent sul- 
phate of soda into the dye bath. 

Maroon Dye for Woolens. — To pre- 
pare the dye bath, dissolve about 1 pound 
of maroon dye in boiling water, with or 
without the addition of methylated spirit 
of wine. For dark shades dissolve in 
boiling water, only slightly acidulated 
with hydrochloric acid, and filter before 
use. No mordant is required with this 
dye when dyeing wool, hut for the bright 
shade a little curd soap may be dissolved 
in the dye bath before proceeding to dye 
the wool, while for the dark shade it is 
best to put in a little acetate of soda. To 
use the dye, first dye in a weak bath and 
gradually strengthen it until the desired 
shade is obtained, at the same time grad- 



ually increasing the temperature untfl 
just below the boiling point. 

To Dye Woolens with Blue de Lyons — 
Dissolve 8 ounces of blue dye in 1 g a u* 
of methylated spirit, which has been 
slightly soured with sulphuric acid and 
boil the solution over a water bath'until 
it is perfectly clear. To prepare the dve 
bath, add more or less of the spirituous 
tincture to a 10- or 15- gall on dye bath of 
water, which has been slightly soured 
with sulphuric acid. 

Rich Orange on Woolen. — Dissolve 1 
pound of phosphine in 15 gallons of 
boiling water, and stir the fluid until the 
acid has dissolved. No mordant is re- 
quired to dye wool. First work the 
goods about in a weak solution, and 
finally in one of full strength, to which 
a little acetate of soda has been added. 
Keep up the temperature to just below 
the boiling point while working the goods 
in the dye bath. 

DYEING SILK OR COTTON FABRICS 
WITH ANILINE DYES: 

Aniline Blue on Cotton. — Prepare a 
dye bath by dissolving 1 pound of ani- 
line blue (soluble in spirit) in 10 gallons 
of water, and set it aside to settle. 
Meanwhile prepare a mordant while 
boiling 35 ounces of sumac (or 5i 
ounces tannic acid in 30 gallons of water) 
and then dissolve therein 17 ounces of 
curd soap. Boil up and filter. Put the 
cotton goods in the hot liquid and let 
them remain therein for 12 hours. Then 
wring them out and make up a dye bath 
of Tw. with red liquor. Add dye 
color according to the shade desired. 
Put in the goods and work them until the 
color is correct, keeping the temperature 
at the boiling point. 

To Dye Silk a Delicate Greenish Yel- 
low.— Dissolve 2 ounces of citronine ml 
gallon of methylated spirit and keep tie 
solution hot over a water bath untd per- 
fectly clear. 

To prepare silk fabrics, wash them in 
a weak soap liquor that has been iusi 
sweetened (i. e., its alkalinity turned to 
■ a slight sourness) with a little sulphur"; 
acid. Work the goods until dyed to 
shade, and then rinse them in cold 
that has been slightly acidulated vrim 
acetic, tartaric, or citric acid.

To Dye Felt Goods.— Owing to this 
material being composed of animal and 
vegetable fiber it is not an easy matter al- 
ways to produce evenness of shade. 1 he 
best process to insure success is to steep 
ffe ll the felt in an acid bath of from 6° 
to 12° Be., and then wash away all traces 
of add. Some dyers make the fulling 
stork the medium of conveying the dye, 
while others partially dye before fulling, 
or else dye after that process.

Soluble Blue, Ball Blue, etc. — A solu- 
ble blue has for many years been readily 
obtainable in commerce which is similar 
in appearance to Prussian blue, but, un- 
like the latter, is freely soluble in water. 
This blue is said to be potassium ferri- 
ferro cyanide. 

To prepare instead of buying it ready 
made, gradually add to a boiling solu- 
tion of potassium ferricyanide (red prus- 
siate of potash) an equivalent quantity 
of hot solution of ferrous sulphate, boil- 
ing for 2 hours and washing the precip- 
itate on a filter until the washings assume 
a dark-blue color. The moist precipitate 
can at once be dissolved by the further 
addition of a sufficient quantity of water. 
About 64 parts of the iron salt is neces- 
sary to convert 100 parts of the potassium 
salt into the blue compound. 

If the blue is to be sent out in the 
liquid form, it is desirable that the solu- 
tion should be a perfect one. To attain 
that end the water employed should be 
free from mineral substances, and it is 
best to filter the solution through several 
thicknesses of fine cotton cloth before 
bottling; or if made in large quantities 
this method may be modified ty avow- 
ing it to stand some days to settle, when 
the top portion can be siphoned off for 
use, tie Lttom only retiring ; filtratiom

of hydiogen sulphide are madeto flow 
quickly and with constant stirring into 
a heated solution of 20 parts of isatine 
anilide in 60 parts of alcohol. With 
spontaneous heating and temporary 
green and blue coloration, an immediate 
separation of indigo in small crystalline 
needles of a faint copper luster takes 
place. Boil for a short time, whereupon 
the indigo is filtered off, rewashed with 
alcohol, and dried. 

To Dye Feathers. — A prerequisite to 
the dyeing of feathers appears to be soft- 
ening them, which is sometimes accom- 
plished by soaking them in warm water, 
and sometimes an alkali, such as ammo- 
nium or sodium carbonate, is added. 
This latter method would apparently be 
preferable on account of the removal of 
any greasy matter that may be present. 

When so prepared the feathers may be 
dyed by immersion in any dye liquor. 
An old-time recipe for black is immersion 
in a bath of ferric nitrate suitably diluted 
with water, and then in an infusion of 
equal parts of logwood and quercitron. 
Doubtless an aniline dye would prove 
equally efficient and would be less trou- 
blesome to use. 

After dyeing, feathers are dipped in an 
emulsion formed by agitating any bland 
fixed oil with water containing a little 

Eotassiuin carbonate, arid are then dried 
y gently swinging them in warm air. 
This operation gives the gloss. 

Curling where required is effected by 
slightly warming the feathers before a 
fire, and then stroking with a blunt me- 
tallic edge, as the back of a knife. A 
certain amount of manual dexterity is 
necessary to carry the whole process to 
a successful ending.

Eggs 

The age of eggs may be approximately 
judged by taking advantage of the fact 
that as they grow old their density de- 
creases through evaporation of moisture. 
According to Sicbel, a new-laid egg 
placed in a vessel of brine made in the 
proportion of 2 ounces of salt to 1 pint of 
water, will at once sink to the bottom. 
An egg 1 day old will sink below the 
surface, but not to the bottom, while one 
3 days old will swim just immersed in 
the liquid. If more than 3 days old the 
egg will float, on the surface, the amount 
of shell exposed increasing with age; and 
if 2 weeks old, only a little of the shell 
will dip in the liquid. 

The New York State Experiment Sta- 
tion studied the changes in the specific 
gravity of the eggs on keeping and found 
that on an average fresh eggs had a 
specific gravity of 1.090; after they were 
10 days old, of 1.072; after 20 days, of 
1.053; and after 80 days, of 1.035. The 
test was not continued further. The 
changes in specific gravity correspond to 
the changes in water content. TV hen 
eggs arc kept they continually lose water 
by evaporation through the pores in the 
shell. After 10 days the average loss 
was found to be 1.00 per cent of the 
total water present in the egg when per- 
fectly fresh; after 20 days, 3.16 per cent; 
and after 30 days, 5 per cent. The aver- 
age temperature of the room where tne 
eggs were kept was 03.8° F. The evap- 
oration was found to increase somcwiiai 
with increased temperature, rsone o 
the eggs used in the 30-day test spoiieo. 

Fresh eggs are preserved in a numu 
of ways which may, for convenience, n 
grouped under two general classes: 



Use of low temperature, i. e., cold sto - 
age; and (2) excluding the air by costl ^ 
covering, or immersing the e £& s ' 
material or solution being used 
may or may not be a germicide
