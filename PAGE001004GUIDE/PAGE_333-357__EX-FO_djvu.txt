Foreign Matter in the Eye.— If a piece 
of iron or other foreign matter in the eye 
irritates it, and there is no way of remov- 
ing it until morning, take a raw Irish 
potato, grate it, and use as a poultice on 
the eye. It will ease the eye so one can 
sleep, and sometimes draws the piece 
out. 

Drops of Lime in the Eye. — If lime has 
dropped in the eye, the pouring-in of or 
the wiping-out with a few drops of oil is 
the best remedy, as the causticity of the 
lime is arrested thereby. Poppy-seed 
oil or olive oil is prescribed, but pure lin- 
seed oil ought to render the same service, 
as it is also used in the household. Sub- 
sequently, the eye may be rinsed out with 
syrup, as the saccharine substance will 
harden any remaining particles of lime 
and destroy all causticity entirely.

when the fat has been recovered by 
means of steam. It consists In cutting 
up the fat into small fragments and ex- 
posing it to the air for several days, the 
mass being turned over at intervals with 
a shovel. When sufficiently bleached in 
this manner, the fat is boiled with half 
its own weight of water, which done, 
about 3 or 4 per cent of salt is added, 
and the whole is boiled over again. This 
treatment, which takes 2 or 3 weeks, 
sweetens the fat, makes it of the consist- 
ency of butter, and reduces the color to a 
pale yellow. Light seems to play no 
part in the operation, the change being 
effected solely by the oxygen of the air. 
The chemical treatment has the advan- 
tage of being more rapid, sufficient de- 
coloration being produced in a few 
hours. The fat, which should be free 
from gelatin, phosphate of lime, and 
water, is placed in an iron pan along 
with an equal weight of brine of 14° to 
15° Be. strength, with which it is boiled 
for 3 hours and left to rest overnight. 
Next day the fat is drawn off into a 
wooden vessel, where it is treated by 
degrees with a mixture of 2 parts of 
potassium bichromate, dissolved in 6 of 
boiling water, and 8 parts of hydro- 
chloric acid (density 22° Be.), this quan- 
tity being sufficient for 400 parts of fat. 
Decoloration proceeds gradually, and 
when complete the fat is washed with hot 
water. 

Bleaching Tallows and Fats.— In- 
stead of exposing to the sun, which is 
always attended with danger of render- 
ing fats rancid, it is better to liquefy these 
at a gentle heat, and then add i in weight 
of a mixture of equal parts of kaoli n ana 
water. The fatty matter should be 
Worked up for a time and then left to 
separate. Kaolin has the advantage of 
cheapness in price and of being readily 
procured. J 

Freshly turned animal charcoal would 
perhaps be a more satisfactory decolor- 
ize than kaolin, but it is more expen- 
sive to start with, and not so easy to re- 
generate. 1 

Exposure of tallow to the action of 
steam under high pressure (a tempera- 
ture of 250° or 260- F.) is also said to 
render jt whiter and harder.

Fatty Acid Fermentation Process 
The production of fatty acids from fate 
and oils by fermentation is growing in 
importance. These particulars, which 
are the actual results from recent exneri 
ments on a somewhat extended scale are 
given: Seven hundred and fifty pounds of 
cottonseed oil are mixed with 45 gallons 
of water and 3A pounds of acetic acid' 

*b j?*S U1 V S heated t0 a temperature 
ot 85 h. Castor-oil seeds, 53 pounds 
decorticated and ground, are mixed 
thoroughly with 3 gallons of water and 
4* gallons of the oil, and this mixture is 
stirred into the oil and water; the whole 
masses then kept mixed for 12 hours by 
blowing air through, after which it is 
allowed to stand for another 12 hours, 
being given a gentle stir by hand at the 
end of every hour. After 24 hours the 
mass is heated to a temperature of 180° 
F., which stops the fermentation and 
at the same time allows the fatty acids to 
separate more freely. To assist in this 
effect there is added 1 gallon of sulphuric 
acid (1 in 3) solution. 

After 2 hours' standing, the mass will 
have separated into three layers— fatty 
acids on the top, glycerine water below, 
and a middle, undefined layer. The 
glycerine water is run away, and the 
whole mass left to stand for 2 hours. 
The middle portion is run off from the 
separated fatty acids into another vessel, 
where it is mixed with 10 gallons of hot 
water, thoroughly stirred, and allowed to 
stand for 16 hours or more. The watery 
layer at the bottom, which contains some 
glycerine, is then run off, while the resi- 
due is mixed with a further quantity ot 
10 gallons of water, and again allowed to 
stand. The water which separates out, 
also the layer of fatty acids that forms on 
the top, are run off and mixed with the 
portions previously obtained. The va- 
rious glycerine waters are treated to re- 
cover the glycerine, while the fatty acios 
are made marketable in any convenient 
way.

Ht preserving properties are derived 

Tfie process consists of heating for 
example, 6 parts of oil with 1 part of sul- 
3mr to a temperature varying between 
?00° and 400° F., then, when at about 
ins* F a solution of iodine and oil is 
added to the mixture, which is constantly 
agitated until cool to prevent lumps 
forming- A product is thus obtained 
which acquires the consistency ot butter, 
and contains both iodine and sulphur m 
combination. 

Purifying Oils and Fats.— In purifying 
fatty oils and fats for edible purposes the 
chief thing is to remove the free fatty 
acids, which is done by the aid of solu- 
tions of alkalies and alkaline earths. 
The subsequent precipitation of < the 
resulting soapy emulsions, especially 
when lime is used, entails prolonged 
heating to temperatures sometimes as 
high as the boiling point of water. 
Furthermore, the amount, of alkalies 
taken is always greater than is chemically 
necessary, the consequence being that 
some of the organic substances present 
are attacked, and malodorous products 
are formed, a condition necessitating the 
employment of animal charcoal, etc., 
as deodorizer. 

To prevent the formation of these un- 
toward products, which must injuriously 
affect the quality of edible oils, C. Fre- 
senius proposes to accelerate the disper-

ORING :

Bleaching and Coloring Feathers.— 
Feathers, in their natural state, are not 
adapted to undergo the processes of dye- 
ing and bleaching; they must be prepared 
by removing their oil and dirt. This is 
usually done by washing them in moder- 
ately warm soap and water, and rinsing 
in warm and cold water; or the oil may 
be chemically removed by the use of ben- 
zine. To remove it entirely, the feathers 
must be left in the cleansing fluid from 
a half hour to an hour, when they may be 
subjected to the process of bleaching. 

Bleaching Plumes. — Plumes may he 
almost entirely bleached by the use of 
hydrogen peroxide, without injuring 
their texture. 

In specially constructed glass troughs, 
made the length of an average ostrich 
feather, 15 or 20 of these feathers can be 
treated at a time. The bleaching fluid 
is made from a 30 per cent solution of 
hydrogen ■ peroxide, with enough am- 
monia added to make it neutral; m other

As a result of a series of experiments 
Schloesmg stated that the nitrificationnf 
ammonium salts is not for all plants a 
necessary preliminary to the absorption of 
nitrogen by the plant. While for some 
plants, as for example buckwheat the 
preferable form of the food material is 
that of a nitrate, others, for instance, 
tropeolum, thrive even better when the 
nitrogen is presented to them in an 
amrnoniacal form. 

Artificial Fertilizers for Pot Plants.— 

Experiments on vegetation have shown 
that a plant will thrive when the lacking 
substances are supplied in a suitable 
form, e. g., in the following combinations.* 

I. — Calcium nitrate, potassium _ ni- 
trate, potassium phosphate, magnesiurr 
phosphate, ferric phosphate (sodiurs 
chloride). 

II. — Calcium nitrate, ammonium ni- 
trate, potassium sulphate, magnesiun 
phosphate, iron chloride (or sulphate) 
(sodium silicate). 

It is well known that in nature nitrate* 
are formed wherever decomposition or 
organic nitrogenous substances takes 
place in the air, the ammonia formed oy 
the decomposition being oxidize d 
nitric acid. These conditions for ^ 
formation of nitrates are present 
nearly every cornfield, and they ; are : a«° 
the cause of the presence of nltr **j°les 
water that has its source near stav -

_ Preparing Bone for Fertilizer.— Bone, 
in its various forms, is the only one of 
I the insoluble phosphates that" is now 
used directly upon the soil, or without 
other change than is accomplished by 
mechanical action or grinding. The 
terms used to indicate the character of 
the bone have reference rather to their 
mechanical form than to the relative 
availability of the phosphoric acid con- 
tained in them. The terms raw bone, 
fine bone, boiled and steamed bone, etc., 
are used to indicate methods of prep- 
aration, and inasmuch as bone is a 
material which is useful largely in pro- 
portion to its rate of decay, its fineness 
has an important bearing upon availabil- 
ity, since the finer the bone the more sur- 
face is exposed to the action of those 
forces which cause decav or solution, an 
the quicker will the constituents beco 
available. In the process of boiling or 
steaming, not only is the bone made baei 
but its physical character in 0 ,- r j r " 
spects is also changed, the P artieJ ^ f ; 
whether fine or coarse, being made so 
and crumbly rather than dense or flartj, 
hence it is more likely to act quicKlJ' . ' , 
if the same degree of fineness be oMfli'"£ 
by simple grinding. The P*°*$£ e 
acid in fine steamed bone may all toecoj ^ 
available in 1 or 2 years, while the co » 
fatty raw bone sometimes resist* 
decay for 3 or 4 years or even long

Wed bone may contain as high as 28 
went of phosphoric acid and as low as 
? ner cent of nitrogen. Steamed bone is 
Villv therefore, much richer m phos- 
phoric acid and has less nitrogen than 
the raw bone. 

Brewers' Yeast and Fertilizers. — A 
mixture is made of about 2 parts of 
yeast with 1 part of sodium chlonde and 
5 parts of calcium sulphate, by weight, 
for use as a manure. Pure or impure 
yeast, or veast previously treated for the 
extraction of a portion of its constituents, 
m av be used, and the gypsum may be 
replaced by other earthy substances of a 
similar non-corrosive nature. 

Authorities seem to agree that lime is 
necessary to the plant, and if it be 
wholly lacking in the soil, even though 
an abundance of all the other essential 
elements is present, it cannot develop 
normally. Many soils are well provided 
with lime by nature and it is seldom or 
never necessary for those who cultivate 
them to resort to liming. It wouM be 
just as irrational to apply lime where it is 
not needed as to omit it where it is re- 
quired, and hence arises the necessity of 
ascertaining the needs of particular soils 
in this respect. 

The method usually resorted to for 
ascertaining the amount of lime in soils 
is to treat them with some strong mineral 
acid, such as hydrochloric acid, and de- 
termine the amount of lime which is thus 
dissolved. The fact that beets of all 
tL nds make a ready response to limmg 
? n B °Js which, are deficient in lime may 
Se utilized as the basis of testing.

. To Keep Files Clean (see also Clear, 
mg Preparations and Methods). -Th e ^ 
even working of a file is usually due to the 
fact that filings clog the teeth' of the file 
lo obviate this evil, scratch brush th 
hies before use, and then grease the 
with olive oil. A hie prepared in thi 
manner lasts for a longer time, does no" 
become so quickly filled with filings an 
can be conveniently cleaned with an or 
dinary rough brush. 

Recutting Old Files.— Old files may b 
rendered useful again by the followin 

Erocess: Boil them in a potash bat 
rush them with a hard brush and wip 
off. Plunge for half a minute into nitri 
acid, and pass over a cloth stretche 
tightly on a flat piece of wood. Th 
effect will be that the acid remains in t" 
grooves, and will take away the stee 
without attacking the top, which has 
been wiped dry. The operation may be 
repeated according to the depth to be ob- 
tained. Before using the files thus treated 
they should be rinsed in water and dried.

ening of the sponge it is said to admit of 
Tverv quick and clear filtration ot large 
quantities of tinctures, juices, etc 

For filtering water on a small scale, 
and for domestic use, "alcarrazas, 
diaphragms of porous earthenware and 
filtering-stone and layers of sand and 
charcoal etc., are commonly employed 
as filtering. . 

A cheap, useful form of portable filter 
is the following, given in the proceedings 
of the British Association: lake any 
common vessel, perforated below, such 
as a flower pot, fill the lower portion with 
coarse pebbles, over which place a layer 
of finer ones, and on these a layer of clean 
coarse sand. On the top of this a piece 
of burnt clay perforated with small holes 
should be put, and on this again a 
stratum of 3 or 4 inches thick of well- 
burnt, pounded animal charcoal. A 
filter thus formed will last a considerable 
time, and will be found particularly use- 
ful in removing noxious and putrescent 
substances held in solution by water." 

The "portable filters," in stoneware, 
that are commonly sold in the shops, 
contain a stratum of sand, or coarsely 
powdered charcoal; before, however, 
having access to this, the water has to 
pass through a sponge, to remove the 
coarser portion of the impurities. 

Alum Process of Water Purification. — 
Water may be filtered and purified by 
precipitation, by means of alum, by add- 
ing a 4 per cent solution to the water to 
be clarified until a precipitate is no longer 
produced. After allowing the turbid mix- 
ture to stand for 8 hours, the clear portion 
may be decanted or be siphoned off. 
About % grains of alum is ordinarily re- 
quired to purify a gallon of water. 
t otassa_ alum only should be used, as 
ammonia alum cannot be used for this 
purpose. The amount of alum re- 
quired varies with the water, so that an 
initial experiment is required whenever 
water trom a new source is being purified. 
m the purification is properly done, the 
water will not contain any alum, but 
only a, trace of potassium sulphate, for

For Textiles.-pL— Up to the presen 
this has generally been accomplished b 
the use of a combination of water glas 
or soluble glass and fungstate of soda 
The following is cheaper and more suit 
able for the purpose: 

Equal parts, by weight, of commercia 
white copperas, Epsom salt, and sal am 
moniac are mingled together and mixe 
with three times their weight of ammoni 
alum ; This mixture soon changes int 
a moist pulp or paste, that must Be dri 
by a low heat. When dressing the m 
tcrial, add £ part of this combination t 
every 1 part of starch. 

II. — Good results are also obtaine 
from the following formula: Supersat 
rate a quantity of superphosphate o 
lime with ammonia, filter, and decolori 
it with animal charcoal. Concentra 
the solution and mix with it 5 per ce 
of gelatinous silica, evaporate the water 
dry, and pulverize. For use mix 30 parts 
of this powder with 35 parts of gum and 
35 parts of starch in sufficient water to 
make of suitable consistency.

Fireproofing of Wood.-Strictly spca]f 
ing, it is impossible to render wood r n 
pletely incombustible, but an almost ah" 
solute immunity against the attacks of 
fire can be imparted. 1 
Gay-Lussac was one of the first to la! 
down the principal conditions indispen. 
sable for rendering organic matters m 
general and wood in particular, unin- 
nam triable. 

During the whole duration of the 
action of the heat the fibers must be kept 
from contact with the air, which would 
cause combustion. The presence of 
borates, silicates, etc., imparts this prop- 
erty to organic bodies. 

Combustible gases, disengaged by the 
action of the heat, must be mingled in 
sufficient proportion with other gases 
difficult of combustion in such a way that 
the disorganization of bodies by heat will 
be reduced to a simple calcination with- 
out production of flame. Salts volatile 
or decomposable by heat and not com- 
bustible, like certain ammoniacal salts, 
afford excellent results. 

Numerous processes have been rec- 
ommended for combating the inflam- 
mability of organic tissues, some consist" 
iner in external applications, others W

y^\ er \ The wood thus treated is said to 
be perfectly incombustible even at great 
heat, and, besides, to be also protected by 
tins method against decay, injurv bv in- 
sects, and putrefaction. 

VII.— One of the simplest methods is 
to saturate the timber with a, solution of 
tungstate of soda; if this is done in a 
vacuum chamber, by means of which the 
wood is_ partly deprived of the air con- 
tained in its cells, a very satisfactory 
result will be obtained. Payne's process 
consists in treating wood under these 
conditions first with solution of sul- 
phate of iron, and then with chloride of 
calcium; calcium sulphate is thus pre- 
cipitated in the tissues of the timber, 
which is rendered incombustible and 
much more durable. There are several 
other methods besides these, phosphate 
of ammonia and tungstate being most 
useful. A coat of common whitewash is 
an excellent means of lessening the com- 
bustibility of soft wood. 

Fireprooflng Wood Pulp.— The pulp

bleached shellac has been dissolved, and 
blow one of these liquids upon the freshly 
pounced design by means of an atomizer. 
After drying, the drawing will have the 
desired fixedness.

red, and even blue and violet 
shades on wood can be obtained, it being 
necessary only to make a previous ex- 
tjeriment with the stains on a piece of 
suitable wood. In the case of soft wood, 
however, it is advisable to stain the whole 
previously with ordinary nut stain (not 
too dark), and only after drying to coat 
with oil stain, because the autumn rings 
of the wood take no color, and would 
appear too light, and, therefore, disturb 
the effect.

for is to imbed the p ants in a mixture 
equal quantities o/ plaster of Paris and 
ie! and gradually heat them to a tem- 
rature of 100° F. After this the 
lower looks dusty, but if it is laid aside f or 
an hour so as to absorb sufficient mois- 
ture to destroy its brittleness, it can be 
dusted without injury. To remove the 
lioary appearance which is often left, 
pen after dusting, a varnish composed of 
nces of dammar and 16 ounces of 
oil of turpentine should be used and a 
second coat given if necessary. When 
the gum has been dissolved in the tur- 

Eentine, 16 ounces of benzoline should 
e added, and the whole should be 
strained through fine muslin. 

III. — Five hundred parts ether, 20 parts 
transparent copal, and 20 parts sand. 
The flowers should be immersed in the 
varnish for 2 minutes, then allowed to dry 
for 10 minutes, and this treatment should 
be repeated 5 or 6 times.

and licie, which is applied Tightly. Very 
fine parts of the flowers, such as stamens, 
etc., may be previously supported by 
special attachments of textures, wire, 
etc. After the drying of the coating the 
whole is covered with shellac solution 
or with a mixture of glue, gypsum, lime 
with lead acetate, oil, mucilage, glycer-

FOOD ADULTERANTS, SIMPLP n> B 
FOR THEIR DETECTION ESTS 

Abstract of a monograph by to n 
Bigelow and Burton J, Howard . ' 
lished by the DepartmcntX^- 

Generally speaking, the methods rtl 
chemical _ analysis employed in j °j 
laboratories can be manipulated onlvU 
one who has had at least the usual eofieS 
course in chemistry, and some sp«S 
training in the examination of foods is 
almost as necessary. Again, most of the 
apparatus and chemicals necessary are 
entirely beyond the reach of the home 
and the time consumed by the ordinary 
examination of a food is in itself pro- 
hibitive. 

Yet there are some simple tests which 
serve to point out certain forms of adul- 
teration and can be employed by the 
careful housewife with the reagents in 
her medicine closet and the apparatus in 
her kitchen. The number may be great- 
ly extended by the purchase of a very 
few articles that may be procured for a 
few cents at any drug store. In apply- 
ing these tests, one general rule must 
always be kept carefully in mind. Every 
one, whether layman or chemist, must 
familiarize himself with a reaction be- 
fore drawing any conclusions from it. For 
instance, before testing a sample of sup- 
posed coffee for starch, the method 
should be applied to a sample of pure 
coffee (which can always be procured 
unground) and to a mixture of pure 
coffee and starch prepared by the oper- 
ator. 

Many manufacturers and deaI ^ s ,I" 
foods have the ordinary senses so iugM 
developed that by their aid alone tnej 
can form an intelligent opinion ot vx 
nature of a product, or of the ch» r *^ 
and sometimes even of the proporiio 

adulterants present. This V Sp *2ne 
-1« as coffee, ^ ine -' 



true of 



such articles as cuucn j 
salad oils, flavoring extracts, butter, 
milk. The housewife finds nert< f C £fe 
stantly submitting her P« rcliase L. P i c ,pS 
test. Her broad experience 
her senses of taste and smell to . B oft * B 
degree, and her discrimination 3^ j,^ 
sharper and more accurate than ^ Q 
self realizes. The manufacturer 
has developed his natural sense*.

P° few simple chemical tests can 



*1 j n her field of vision and detect 
^"acy impurities that are not evident to 

"^nfere'are here given methods adapted 
tn this purpose, which may be applied to 
mi k butter, coffee spices olive oil, 
Sn^ar, jams and jellies, and flavoring 
^ffrt. In addition to this some gen- 
Sd methods for the detection of coloring 
la ter and preservatives wall be given. 
?ll nf the tests here described may be 
performed with utensils found in any 
wel appointed kitchen. It will be con- 
venient however, to secure a small glass 
funnel, about 3 inches in diameter, since 
filtration is directed m a number of the 
methods prescribed. Filter paper can 
best be prepared for the funnel by cut- 
tine a circular piece about the proper 
size and folding it once through the mid- 
dle, and then again at right angles to the 
first fold. The paper may then be 
opened without unfolding in such a way 
that three thicknesses lie together on one 
side and only one thickness on the other. 
In this way the paper may be made to 
fit nicely into the funnel. 

Some additional apparatus, such as 
test tubes, racks for supporting them, 
and glass rods, will be found more con- 
venient for one who desires to do consid- 
erable work on this subject, but can be 
dispensed with. The most convenient 
size for test tubes is a diameter of from 
\ to | inch, and a length of from. 5 to 6 
inches. A graduated cylinder will also 
he found very convenient. If this is 
graduated according to the metric sys- 
tem, a cylinder containing about 100 
cubic centimeters will be found to be 
convenient; if the English liquid measure 
is used it may be graduated to from 3 to 
8 ounces. 

Chemical Reagents. — The word "re- 
agent" is applied to "any substance used 
to effect chemical change in another 
substance for the purpose of identifying 
component parts or determining its 
percentage composition." The follow- 
ing reagents are required in the methods 
here given: 

Turmeric paper. 

Iron alum (crystal or powdered form). 
Hydrochloric acid (muriatic acid), 
concentrated. 

Caution.— Ml tests in which hydro- 
chloric acid is used should be conducted 
111 glass or earthen ware, for this acid at- 



tacks and will imure metal vessels. C. 
must also be taken not to bring it i, 
contact with the flesh or clothes. If 
accident, a drop of it falls upon 'the 
clothes, ammonia, or in its absence a 
solution of saleratus or sal soda (wash 
ing soda), in water, should be armlie 
promptly. * v 



Iodine tincture,. 

Potassium permanganate, 1 per c 
solution. 

Alcohol (grain alcohol). 
Chloroform. 
Boric acid or borax. 
Ammonia water. 
Hal ph en's reagent. 
With the exception of the last feagent 
mentioned, these substances may be 
obtained in any pharmacy. The Hal- 
phen reagent should be prepared by a 
druggist, certainly not by an inexperi- 
enced person. 

It is prepared as follows: An approx- 
imately 1 per cent solution of sulphur is 
made by dissolving about | of a tea- 
spoonful of precipitated sulphur in 3 or 
4 ounces of carbon bisulphide. This 
solution mixed with an equal volume of 
amyl alcohol forms the reagent required 
by the method. A smaller quantity than 
that indicated by these directions may, 
of course, be prepared. • 
If turmeric paper be not available it 
may be made as follows: Place a bit of 
turmeric powder (obtainable at any drug 
store) in alcohol, allow it to stand for a 
few minutes, stir, allow it to stand again 
until it settles, dip a strip of filter paper 
into the solution, and dry it.

fruit products of all kinds, including 
beverages. It is frequently sold by drug 
stores as fruit acid. Preserving powders 
consisting entirely of salicylic acid are 
often carried from house to house by 
agents. It may be detected as follows: 

Between 2 and 3 ounces of the liquid 
obtained from the fruit products, as de- 
scribed above, are placed in a narrow 
bottle holding 5 ounces, about a quarter 
of a teaspoonful of cream of tartar (or, 
better, a few drops of sulphuric acid) is 
added, the mixture shaken for 2 or 3 
minutes, and filtered into a second small 
bottle. Three or 4 tablespoonfuls of 
chloroform are added to the clear liquid 
in the second bottle and the liquids 
mixed by a somewhat vigorous rotary 
motion, poured into an ordinary glass 
tumbler, and allowed to stand till the 
chloroform settles out in the bottom. 
Shaking is avoided, as it causes an emul- 
sion which is difficult to break up. As 
much as possible of the chloroform layer 
(which now contains the salicylic acid) 
is removed (without any admixture of 
the aqueous liquid) by means of a medi- 
cine dropper and placed in a test tube or 
small bottle with about an equal amount 
of water and a small fragment — a little 
larger than a pin head — of iron alum. 
The mixture is thoroughly shaken and 
allowed to stand till the chloroform again 
settles to the bottom. The presence of 
salicylic acid is then indicated by the 
purple color of the upper layer of liquid. 

Detection of Benzoic Acid. — Benzoic 
acid is also used for preserving fruit prod- 
ucts. Extract the sample with chloro- 
form as in the case of salicylic acid; 
remove the chloroform layer and place it 
in a white saucer, or, better, in- a plain 
glass sauce dish. Set a basin of water- 
as warm as the hand can bear— on the 
outside window ledge and place the dish 
containing the chloroform extract in it, 
closing the window until the chloroform 
uas completely evaporated. In this 
manner the operation may be conducted 
with safety even by one who is not accus- 
tomed to handling chloroform. In 
warm weather the vessel of warm water 
may, of course, be omitted. Benzoic

In testing butter place a heaping tea- 
spoonful of the sample in a teacup add a 
couple of teaspoonfuls of hot water and 
stand the cup in a vessel containing 3 
little hot water until the butter is thor 
oughly melted. Mix the contents of the 
cup well by stirring with a teaspoon and 
set the cup with the spoon in it in a 
cold place until the butter is solid. The 
spoon with the butter (which adheres to 
it) is now removed from the cup and the 
turbid liquid remaining strained through 
a white cotton cloth, or, better, through 
filter paper. The liquid will not all pass 
through the cloth or filter paper, but a 
sufficient amount for the test may be 
secured readily. 

In testing milk for boric acid 2 or 3 
tablespoonfuls of milk are placed in a 
bottle with twice that amount of a 
solution of a teaspoonful of alum in a 
pint of water, shaken vigorously, and 
filtered through filter paper. Here again 
a clear or only slightly turbid liquid 
passes through the paper. 

About a teaspoonful of the liquid ob- 
tained by any one of the methods men- 
tioned above is placed in any dish, not 
metal, and 5 drops of hydrochloric 
(muriatic) acid added. A strip ?j

of solid anr 1 semi-soiid foods, the sample 
must, of course, be prepared by extrac- 
tion with water, as described under sail- 
cvlic acid. The residue left after the 
evaporation of the chloroform, if a con- 
siderable amount of saccharine is present, 
has a distinctly sweet taste. 

The only other substance having a 
sweet taste which may be present in 
foods, i. e., sugar, is not soluble in 
chloroform, and therefore does not 
interfere with this reaction. Certain 
other bodies (tannins) which have an 
astringent taste are present, and as they 
are soluble in chloroform may sometimes 
mask the test for saccharine, but with 
practice this difficulty is obviated. 

Determination of Artificial Colors: 
Detection of Coal-Tar Dyes.— Coloring 
matters used with foods are usually 
soluble in water. If the food under 
examination be a liquid, it may there- 
fore be treated directly by the method 
given below. If it be a solid_ or a pasty 
substance, soluble in water either in the 
cold or after heating, it may be dissolved 
m sufficient water to form a thin liquid. 
If it contains some insoluble material, it 
™ay be treated with sufficient water to 
dissolve the soluble portion with the 
formation of a thin liquid and filtered, 
an d then strained through a clean white 
cotton cloth to separate the insoluble 
Portion. About a half teacupful of the 
u <juid thus described is heated to boiling, 
after adding a few drops of hydrochloric 
ac ia and a small piece of white woolen 
cloth or a few strands of white woolen 
yarn. (Before using, the wool should

teaspoonfuls of household ammonia. 
Remove and free from as much of the 
liquid as possible by squeezing or wring- 
ing. Usually the fabric will retain the 
greater part of the natural fruit color, 
while the coal-tar color dissolves in dilute 
ammonia. The liquid is then stirred 
v, ith a splinter of wood and hydrochloric 
acid added, a drop or two at a time, until 
there is no longer any odor of ammoni 
(The atmosphere of the vessel is som 
times charged with the ammonia f' 
several minutes after it has all bee 
driven out of the liquid; therefore on 
should blow into the dish to remove this 
air before deciding whether the ammonia

enough acid has been added the liquid 
has a sour taste, as may be determined by 
touching the splinter, used in stirring, to 
the tongue. t . ,

Caution. — Be careful not to allow the 
hydrochloric acid to come in contact with 
metals or with the flesh or clothing. 

Detection of Turmeric. — In yellow 
spices, especially mustard and mace, tur- 
meric is often employed. This is espe- 
cially true of prepared mustard to which 
a sufficient amount of starch adulterant 
has been added to reduce the natural 
color materially. If turmeric be em- 
ployed to restore the normal shade an 
indication of that fact may sometimes be 
obtained by mixing a half teaspoonful 
of the sample in a white china dish and 
mixing with it an equal amount of water, 
and a few drops (4 to 10) of household 
ammonia, when a marked brown color, 
which does not appear in the absence of 
turmeric, is formed. At the present 
time turmeric or a solution of curcuma 
(the coloring matter of turmeric) is 
sometimes added to adulterated mus- 
tard in sufficient amount to increase its 
color, but not to a sufficient extent to 
give the brown appearance with ammo- 
nia described above. In such cases a 
teaspoonful of the suspected sample may 
be thoroughly stirred with a couple of 
tablespoonfuls of alcohol, the mixture 
allowed to settle for 15 minutes or more, 
and the upper liquid poured off into a 
clean glass or bottle. To about 1 table- 
spoonful of the liquid thus prepared and 
placed m a small, clear dish (a glass 
salt cellar serves excellently) add 4 or 5 
drops of a concentrated solution of boric 
acid or borax and about 10 drops of hy- 
drochloric acid, and mix the solution by 
stirring with a splinter of wood. A 
wedge-shaped strip of filter paper, about

then suspended by pinning, so that its

to caramel, which is largely removed by 
fullers earth. In applying this test, 
however, it must be borne in mind that 
caramel occurs naturally in malt vinegar, 
being formed in the preparation of the 
malt. It is evident that the tests require 
practice and experience before they can 
be successfully performed. The house- 
wife can use them, but must repeat them 
frequently in order to become proficient 
in their use. 

EXAMINATION OF CERTAIN CLASSES 
OF FOODS: 

_ Canned Vegetables. — These are rela- 
tively free from adulteration by means of 
foreign substances. The different grades 
of products may with care be readily 
detected by the general appearance of 
the sample. The purchaser is, t W 
course, at the disadvantage of not being 
able to see the product until the can is 
opened. By a study of the different 
brands available in the vicinity, however, 
he can readily select those winch are 
preferable. As stated in an earlier part 
of this article, canned tomatoes some- 
times contain an artificial coloring ma 
ter, which may he detected as descrmeu.

rnffee —There are a number of sim- 
, tots 'for the presence of the adulter- 
P i Jof Ground coffee. These are called 
a -™nle because they can be performed 
S ^m,t the facilities of the chemical 
laboratory, and by one who has not had 
S! experience and training of a chemist. 
It must be understood that they require 
ireful observation and study, and that 
must perform them repeatedly m 
nrder to obtain reliable results. Before 
, nD l v ine them to the examination of an 
unknown sample, samples of known 
character should be secured and studied. 
Unbound coffee may be ground m the 
home and mixed with various kinds of 
adulterants, which can also be secured 
separately. Thus the articles themselves 
in known mixtures may be studied, and 
when the same results are obtained with 
unknown samples they can be correctly 
interpreted. These tests are well known 
in the laboratory and may be used in the 
home of the careful housewife who has 
the time and perseverance to master 
them. 

Physical Tests,— The difference be- 
tween the genuine ground coffee and the 
adulterated article can often be detected 
by simple inspection with the naked eye. 
This is particularly true if the product 
be coarsely crushed rather than finely 
ground. In such condition pure coffee 
has a quite uniform appearance, whereas 
the mixtures of peas, beans, cereals, 
chicory, etc., often disclose their hetero- 
geneous nature to the careful observer. 
This is particularly true if a magnifying 
glass be employed. The different arti- , 
cles composing the mixture may then be 
separated by the point of a pen-knife. 
The dark, gummy-looking chicory par- 
ticles stand out in strong contrast to the 
other substances used, and their nature 
can be determined by one who is familiar 
with them by their astringent taste. 
. The appearance of the coffee particles 
is also quite distinct from that of many 
of the coffee substitutes employed. The 
coffee has a dull surface, whereas same 
of its substitutes, especially leguminous 
Pjoducts, often present the appearance 
of having a polished surface. 

A^er a careful inspection of the sample 
with the naked eye, or, better, with a 
Magnifying glass, a portion of it may be 
Placed in a small bottle half full of water 
& nd shaken. The bottle is then placed | 



on the table for a moment. Pure coffe 
contains a large amount of oil, by reason 
of which the greater portion of'tKSple 
will float M\ coffee substitutes anc ? 



some particles of coffee sink to the bot- 
tom of the hqmd. A fair idea of the 
purity of the sample can often be deter- 
mined by the proportion of the sample 
which, floats or sinks. 

Chicory contains a substance which 
dissolves in water, imparting a brownish- 
red color. When the suspected sample 
is dropped into a glass of water, the 
grains of chicory which it contains may 
be seen slowly sinking to the bottom, 
leaving a train of a dark-brown colored 
liquid behind them. This test appears 
to lead to more errors in the hands of 
inexperienced operators than any other 
test here given. Wrong conclusions 
may be avoided by working first with 
known samples of coffee and chicory as 
suggested above. 

Many coffee substitutes are now sold 
as such and are advertised as more 
wholesome than coffee. Notwithstand- 
ing the claims that are made for them, 
a few of them contain a considerable per- 
centage of coffee. Thi3 may be deter- 
mined by shaking a teaspoonful in a bot- 
tle half full of water, as described above. 
The bottle must be thoroughly shaken 
so as to wet every particle of the sample. 
Few particles of coffee substitutes will 
float. 

Chemical Tests.— Coffee contains no 
starch, while all of the .substances ex- 
cept chicory, used for its addteration 
and in the preparation of .coffee subsh 
tutes contain a considerable 
starch. The presence of such substi 
tutes may, therefore, be

DAIRY PRODUCTS: 

Butter. — Methods are available which, 
with a Jittle practice, may be employed 
to distinguish between fresh butter, 
renovated or process butter, and oleo- 
margarine. , 

These methods are commonly usedm 
food and dairy laboratories. They give 
reliable results. At the same time con- 
siderable practice is necessary before we 
can interpret correctly the results ob- 
tained. Some process butters are on 
the market which can be distinguished 
from fresh butter only with extreme 
difficulty. During the last few years 
considerable progress has been made in 
the attempt to renovate butter in such a 
way that it will appear like fresh butter in 
all respects. A study must be made of 
these methods if we would obtain reliable 
results. 

The "spoon" test has been suggested 
as a household test, and is commonly 
used by analytical chemists for distin- 
guishing fresh butter from renovated 
butter and oleomargarine. A lump of 
butter, £ or 3 times the size of a pea, is 
placed in a large spoon and heated over 
an alcohol or Bunsen burner. If more 
convenient the spoon may be held above 
the chimney of an ordinary kerosene 
lamp, or it may even be held over an 
ordinary illuminating gas burner. If 
the sample in question be fresh butter it 
will boil quietly, with the evolution of 
many small bubbles throughout the mass 
which produce a large amount of foam. 
Oleomargarine and process butter, on 
the other hand, sputter and crackle, 
making a noise similar to that heard 
when a green stick is placed in a fire. 
Another point of distinction is noted if a 
small portt n of the sample be placed in 
a small boUe and set in a vessefof water 
sufficiently warm to melt the butter. 
Ahe sample is kept melted from half an 
Aour to an hour, when it is examined. 
If renovated butter or oleomargarine, 
the fat will be turbid, while if genuine 
fresh butter the fat will almost certainly 
be entirely clear.

K terh ° use °' "milk" test, about g

Milk.— The oldest and simplest™ «. ' 
of adulterating milk is by | \$£!*H 
water. This destroys the Lt S n nth 
ish-whjte color and prod^tfe 
tint .which is sometimes corrected by X 

matt ™ * ° f colo ^g 

Another form of adulteration is the 
removal of the cream and the sale *, 
whole milk of skimmed or partially 
skimmed milk. Again, the difficulty 
experienced in the preservation of milk 
in warm weather has led to the wide- 
spread use of chemical preservatives. 

Detection of Water.— If a lactometer 
or hydrometer, which can be obtained of 
dealers in chemical apparatus, be avail- 
able, the specific gravity of milk will 
afford some clew as to whether the sam- 
ple has been adulterated by dilution with 
water. Whole milk has a specific grav- 
ity between 1.027 and 1.033. The spe- 
cific gravity of skimmed milk is higher, 
and milk very rich in cream is some- 
times lower than these figures. It is 
understood, of course, that by specific 
gravity is meant the weight of a stihstance 
with reference to the weight of an equal 
volume of water. The specific gravity 
of water is 1. It is obvious that if water 
be added to a milk with the specific 
gravity of 1.030, the specific gravity of 
the mixture will be somewhat below 
those figures. 

An indication by means of a h :<iF0 ™' 
eter or lactometer below the figure l.ly 
therefore indicates either that thesainpw 
in question is a very rich milk or toa 
it is a milk (perhaps normal, P e ™g 
skimmed) that has been watered, i 
difference in appearance and nature 
these two extremes is sufficiently obvious 
to make use of the lactometer or hyflr o 
eter of value as a preliminary test o 
purity of milk. . .,

AtablespoonfuU of the sample are placed 
in a teacup with at least an equal amount 
nf strong hydrochloric acid and a piece 
3 ferric alum about as large as a pm- 
head the liquids being mixed by a gentle 
rotar- motion. The cup is then placed 
in a Vessel of boiling water, no further 
heat being applied, and left for 5 min- 
utes At the end of this time, if formal- 
dehyde be present, the mixture will be 
distinctly purple. If too much heat is 
applied, a muddy appearance is imparted 
to the contents of the cup. 

Caution— Great care must be exercised in 
working with hydrochloric acid, as it is 
strongly rorrosive. 

Edible Oils.— With the exception of 
cottonseed oil, the adulterants ordi- 
narily used with edible oils are of such 
a nature that the experience of a chemist 
and the facilities of a chemical labora- 
tory are essential to their detection. ; 
There is, however, a simple test for the 
detection of cottonseed oil, known as the 
Halphen test, which may be readily 
applied. 

Great care must be taken in the manip- 
ulation of this test, as one of the reagents 
employed— carbon bisulphide — is very 
inflammable. The chemicals employed 
in the preparation of the reagent used 
lor this test are not household articles. 
They may, however, be obtained in any 
pharmacy. The mixture should be pre- 
pared by a druggist rather than by an in- 
experienced person who desires to use it. 

In order to perform the test 2 or 3 
tablespoonfuls of this reagent are mixed 
Hi a bottle with an equal volume of the 
suspected sain pie of oil and heated in a 
Vessel of boiling salt solution (prepared 
b y dissolving 1 tablespoonf ul of salt in a 
pint of water) for 10 or 15 minutes. At 
the end of that time, if even a small per- 
centage of cottonseed oil be present, the 
12 



mixture will be of a distinct reddish color 
and il the sample consists largely or 
entirely of cottonseed oil, the color will 
be deep red.

1 he room is darkened and the egg hel

of dark spots indicates that the egg is no 
perfectly fresh, one that is fresh presen 
ing a homogeneous, translucent appear- 
ance. Moreover, there is found in the 
larger end of a fresh egg, between tbe 
shell and the lining membrane, a small 
air cell which, of course, is distinctly 
transparent. In an egg which is not 

Eerfectly fresh this space is filled and 
ence presents the same appearance as 
the rest of the egg. 

It is now a matter of considerable 
importance to be able to distinguish 
between fresh eggs and those that bave 
been packed for a considerable time. 
Until recently that was not a difficult 
matter. All of the solutions that were 
formerly extensively used for that pur- 
pose gave the shell a smooth, glistening 
appearance which is not found m the 
fresh egg. This characteristic, how- 
ever is of less value now than formerly, 
owing to the fact that packed eggs arc 
usually preserved in cold storage.

tract is sometimes adulterated with the 
extract of the Tonka bean. This extract, 
to a certain extent, resembles vanilla 
extract. The extract of the Tonka bean, 
howeYer t is far inferior to that of the 
vanilla bean. It has a relatively pene- 
trating, almost pungent odor, standing 
in sharp contrast to the flavor of the 
vanilla extract. This odor is so different 
that one who has given the matter some 
attention may readily distinguish the 
two, and the quality of the vanilla ex- 
tract may often be judged with a fair 
degree of accuracy by means of the odor 
alone. 

Another form of adulteration, and one 
that is now quite prevalent, is the use of 
artificial vanillin in place of the extract 
of either vanilla or Tonka beans. Arti- 
ficial vanillin has, of course, the same 
composition and characteristics as the 
natural vanillin of the vanilla bean. 
Extracts made from it, however, are 
deficient in the rosins and other products 
which are just as essential to the true 
vanilla, as is vanillin itself. Since 
vanillin is thus obtained from another 
source so readily, methods for the deter- 
mination of the purity of vanilla extract 
must depend upon the presence of other 
substances than vanillin. 

Detection of Caramel. —The coloring 
matter of vanilla extract is due to sub- 
stances naturally present in the vanilla 
bean and extracted therefrom by alcohol 
Artificial extracts made by dissolving 
artificial van dim in alcohol contain no 
color of themselves, and to supply it 
caramel is commonly employed. Cara- 
mel may be detected in artificial extracts 
by shaking and observing the color of

colorless. If caramel is present a color

When the washing is completed the 
rosins may be dissolved by pouring alco- 
hol through the filter. This work with 
the rosins will require some practice be- 
fore it can be successfully performed. It 
is of considerable value, however, in 
judging of the purity of vanilla extract. 

Lemon Extract. — By lemon extract is 
understood a solution of lemon oil in 
strong alcohol. In order to contain as 
much lemon oil as is supposed to be 
found in high-grade extracts the alcohol 
should constitute about SO per cent of 
the sample. The alcohol is therefore 
the most valuable constituent of lemon 
extract, and manufacturers who turn out 
a low-grade product usually do so be- 
cause of their economy of alcohol rather 
than of lemon oil. Owing to the fats 
that lemon extract is practically a satu- 
rated solution of oil of lemon in strong 
alcohol the sample may be examined by 
simple dilution with water. A tea- 
spoonful of the oil in question may be 
placed in the bottom of an ordinary 
glass tumbler and % or 3 teaspoontuis or 
water added. If the sample in question 
be real lemon extract the lemon o 
should be thrown out of solution by rea- 
son of its insolubility in the alcohol atte 
its dilution with water. The result is » 
first a marked turbidity and later u 
separation of the oil of lemon on tt

- ;+ p ro duct3.— Adulteration of fruit 
5£toS practically confined to jellies 
P^f;' ^Contrary to the general 
belief 3 3 atia is never used in makmg 
r;fip!lv In the manufacture of the 
cheapest grade of jellies starch >s 
.ffnips emp oyed. Jellies contam- 
■nTst Tel hoover, are so crude in their 
'iearance that the most superficial 
Section is sufficient to demonstrate 
Sit the! are not pure fruit j elhes. From 
heir appearance no one would think it 
^orth while to examine them to deter- 
mine their purity. 

Natural fruit jellies become liquid on 
being warmed. A spoonful dissolves 
readilv in warm water, although con- 
siderable time is required with those 
that are especially farm. The small 
fruits contain practically -no starch as 
apples do, and the presence of starch m 
a felly indicates that some apple juice 
has probably been used in its prepara- 
tion. 

Detection of Starch.— Dissolve a tea- 
spoonful of jelly in a half teacuptul ot 
hot water, heat to boiling and add, drop 
by drop, while stirring with a teaspoon, a 
solution of potassium permanganate 
until the solution is almost colorless. 
Then allow the solution to cool and test 
for starch with tincture of iodine, as 
directed later. Artificially colored jel- 
lies are sometimes not decolorized by 
potassium permanganate. Even without 
decolorizing, however, the blue color can 
usually be seen. 

Detection of Glucose. — For the detec- 
tion of glucose, a teaspoonful of the jelly 
may be dissolved in a glass tumbler or 
bottle in 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls of water- 
The vessel in which the jelly is dissolved 
may be placed in hot water if necessary 
to hasten the solution. In case a jam or 
marmalade is being examined, the mix- 
ture is filtered to separate the insoluble 
matter. The solution is allowed to cool, 
and an equal volume or a little more of 
strong alcohol is added. If the sample is 
a pure fruit product the addition of 
alcohol causes no precipitation, except 
that a very slight amount of proteid 
bodies is thrown dowvi. If glucose has 
been employed in its manufacture, how- 
ler, a dense -white precipitate separates 
Rtl d, after a time, settles to the bottom of 
the liquid. 



Detection of Foreign Seeda.—In addi- 
t ° ,? e fonns of adulteration to 
which jellies are subject, jams are some- 
times manufactured from the exhausted 
fruit pulp left after removing the juice 
for making jelly. When this is done 
residues from different fruits are some- 
times mixed. Exhausted raspberry oi 
blackberry pulp may be used in making 
_ strawberry" jam and vice versa. Some 
instances are reported of various small 
seeds, such as_ timothy, clover, and 
alfalfa seed, having been used with jams 
made from seedless pulp. 

With the aid of a small magnifying 
glass such forms of adulteration may 
be detected, the observer familiarizing 
himself with the seeds of the ordinary 
fruits. 

Detection of Preservatives and Colors. 
■ — With jellies and jams salicylic and 
benzoic acids are sometimes employed. 
They may be detected by the methods 
given. 

Artificial colors, usually coal-tar deriva- 
tives, are sometimes used and may be 
detected as described. 

Meat Products. —As in many other 
classes of foods, certain questions im- 
portant in the judgment of meats require 
practical experience and close observa- 
tion rather than chemical training. This 
is especially true of meat products, ine 
general appearance of the meat must 
largely guide the purchaser. If, how- 
ever the meat has been treated with pre- 
servatives and coloring matter its appear- 
ance is so changed as to deceive him.
