DOMESTIC PETS. 

The sarcoptic itch of the dog, as well 
as ^at of the cat, is transmissible to man. 
The Tinea tonsurans, the so-called 



barbers' itch, due to a trychophyton, and 
affecting both the dog and cat, is highly 
contagious to man. tavus Tinea ]av 0a 
caused by achonon schoenlemi, of Do ^ 
animals, is readily transmissible to hu- 
heinss. The dog carries in Wi. 



man Demgs. - Vfc , ^.^a ln hls 

intestines many kinds of twnia (t ape . 
worm), among them _ Teem a cchinococ- 
ciis, the eggs of which cause hydatic 
cysts. Hydatic cysts occur in persons 
who arc always surrounded with dogs, 
or in constant contact with them. 

Aviar diphtheria (i. e., the diphtheria

of birds), caused by at least two microbes 
(bacillus of Klebs-Loefher and bacillus 
coli), may easily be transmitted to man 
and cause in him symptoms analogous 
to those of true diphtheritic angina. 

Parrots are subject to an infectious 
enteritis which may be communicated 
to human beings, giving rise to the so- 
called psittacosis (from the Greek, 
psitta, a parrot), of which there have 
been a number of epidemics in France. 
It is determined by the bacillus of No- 

card. . . 

Human tuberculosis is certainly trans- 
mitted to dogs, cats, and birds. Cadiot, 
Gibert, Roger, Benjamin, Petit, and 
Basset, as well as other observers, cite 
cases where dogs, cats, and parrots, 
presenting all the lesions of tuberculosis, 
were shown to have contracted it from 
contact with human beings; while there 
are no recorded cases, there can scarcely 
be a natural doubt that man may, in J 
similar manner, become attainted through 
them, and that their tuberculosis con 
stitutes an actual danger to man- 
Need we recall here the ^ordinary 
facility with which hydrophobia i .com 
municated to man through the dog, cat, 

etc.? i t i,„f vre 

We may, therefore, conclude that 
should not permit these animals M* tjj 
up so much space in our apart* d 
nor should they be petted and car og 
either by adults or children m th \ oase . 
less manner common in nra ,J ^ 
holds. The disgusting habit ot ea 

animals to take bits of fo°*' ' jg* of 
sugar, etc., from between trie ^ fce 
members of the family is & iSV 
shunned. 1 should b e 

Finally, any or all of them s en t 
banished from the house tn« ; &r 
that thev display certain moro \ lieT e 
toms. Besides, in certain o» - nS t 
should be a rigid prophyla^J, f 0 r

^t is important that animals success- 
ful treated for worms once should 
.undergo the treatment a second or third 
time, as all the parasites may not have 
been killed or removed the first time, 
or their progeny may have developed m 
the field vacated by the parents.

German wormsecd,

Fluid extract of vale-

Dose: From £ to 1 tcaspoonful night 
and morning. 

Foot Itch.— The itch that affects the 
feet of poultry is contagious in a most 
Insidious way. The various birds of a 
poultry yard in which the disease is 
prevalent, rarely contract it until after a 
comparatively long period of exposure, 
but sooner or later every bird will con- 
tract it. One infected bird is enough^ to 
infect a whole yard full, and once in- 
fected, it is exceedingly difficult to get 
™ of. The disease, however, affects 
D uds only. 
TV 

a he treatment is simple. Having 
softened the feet by keeping them for 
some minutes in tepid water, the scabs 
a 'rr° VeT tllem are carefully detached, 
tn°v.i ?' as fai as possible, causing them 
tL • ' and taking the precaution of 
growing every scab into the fire. The 
soft then carefully dried, with a bit of 
*aw?°f °? material . which should after- 
isJr , urr >ed; then the entire surface 



Protect the ointment by a proper ap- 
pliance, and allow it to remain in contact 
2 or 3 days. At the end of this time re- 
move the applications and wash off with 
tepid suds. The bird will generally be 
found cured, but if not, repeat the treat- 
ment—removing the remaining scabs, 
which will be found soft enough without 
resorting to soaking in tepid water, ana 
apply the ointment directly. 

There is another method of treatment 
that has been found successful, which 
not only cures the infected birds but 
prevents the infection of others. It is 
simply providing a sand bath for the 
birds, under a little shed, where they can 
indulge themselves in rolling and scratch- 
ing, the bath being composed of equal 
parts fine sand, charcoal m fine powder, 
ashes, and flowers of sulphur, sifted 
together. The bath should be renewed 
every week. In the course of a fei 
weeks the cure is complete.

Roup or Gapes.— Roup in poultry is 
caused by the presence of parasites 
entozoa in the windpipe. Y oung birds 
are most commonly affected. The best 
method of treatment is to expose the 
affected bird to the fumes of heated 
earbolic acid until on the point of sutio- 
eation. The bird may be placed m a 
box with a hot brick, and carbolic acid 
placed thereon. The fowls soon re- 
cover from the incipient suffocation, and 
are. almost always freed from the disease. 
Care must be taken to burn the parasites 
coughed out, and the bodies of any birds 
which may die of the disease. I he 
following powders for the treatment of 
"roup" in poultry have been recom- 
mended: 

I. — Potassium chlorate . . 1 ounce

FOR SHEEP: 

Dips. — For ih.n prevention of "scab" 
in sheep, which results from the burrow- 
ing of an acarus or the destruction of the 
parasite when present, various prepara- 
tions of a somewhat similar character 
are used. The following formulas for 
sheep dips are recommended by the 
United States Department of Agriculture: 

I. — Soap. 1 pound 

Crude carbolic acid. . 1 pint 

Water. 50 gallons 

Dissolve the soap in a gallon or more 
of boiling water, add the acid, and stir 
thoroughly. 

II- — Fresh skimmed milk . . 1 gallon 

Kerosene 2 gallons 

Churn together until emulsified, or 
mix and put i,\to the mixture a force 



pump . 

ernulsification will take 
rapidly if the milk be adde 
ing hot. 

Use 1 gallon of this emulsion to each 
10 gallons of water required.

HI.— A good strong vinegar for house- 
hold use may be made from apple or 
pear peelings. Put the peelings in a 
stone jar (not glazed with lead) or m a 
cask, aud pour over them water and a 
little vinegar, fermented beer, soured 
wine, or beet j uice. Stir well, cover with 
a linen cloth and leave in a warm room. 
The vinegar will be ready in 2 or 3 weeks. 

IV.— Two wooden casks of any desired 
size, with light covers, are provided. 
They may be called A and B . A is filled 
with vinegar, a tenth part of this is 
poured off into B, and an equal amount 
of fermented beer, wine, or any other 
sweet or vinous liquid, or a mixture of 
1.1S5 parts, by weight, of alcohol, 11,500

When vinegar is needed, it is drawn 
out of B, an equal quantity is poured 
from A into B and the same quantity of

To Renew a Broken Barrel Tooth.— 
Frequently, in consequence of the break- 
•nPof a Spring, a tooth of a barrel is 
broken. Sometimes it may only be bent, 
[ n which case the blade of a penknife 
Say be used with care. If 2 or 3 suc- 
cessive teeth are lacking, the best way is 
to^change the barrel, but a single tooth 
m ay be easily renewed in this way: 
Drill a hole through the thickness of the 
tooth, taking care not to penetrate the 
drum; then fit in a piece of metal tightly 
and give it, as well as possible, the cor- 
rect form of the tooth. To assure 
solidity, solder it; then clean and round 
the edges, Properly executed the repair 
will scarcely be noticed. 

Heated Sawdust. — Sawdust is known 
to have been employed from time im- 
memorial by watchmakers and gold- 
smiths for the purpose of drying rinsed 
articles. The process of drying can be 
accelerated four-fold if the sawdust is 
heated before use. This must, however, 
be done with great caution and constant 
stirring. 

To Repair a Dial, etc., with Enamel 
Applied Cold. — There are two kinds of 
false enamel for application, when cold, 
to damaged dials. The first, a mixture 
of -white rosin and white lead, melts like 



— "inic iusih anu wivne ieaa, mens n*.c 
sealing wax, which it closely resembles. 
It is advisable when about to apply it to 
gently heat the dial and the blade of a 



iE ite, and with the knife cut the piece of 

th ai rr 6 1 tne rec L uisite size an(i lay it on 
ne dial. The new enamel must project 
somewhat above the old. When cold

soon. The second false enamel con- 
tains white lead mixed with melted 
white wax. It is applied like cement, 
neatly tiling up the. space and afterwards 
rubbing wjth tissue paper to produce a 
shining surface. If rubbed with a knife 
blade or other steel implement its surface 
will be discolored. 

Lettering a Clock Dial. — Painting 
Roman characters on a clock dial is not 
such a difficult task as might at first be 
imagined. If one has a set of drawing 
instruments and properly proportions the 
letters, it is really simple. The letters 
should be proportioned as follows: The 
breadth of an "I" and a space should 
equal J the breadth of an ,f X," that is, 
if the "X" is } inch broad, the "I" will 
be -, a f inch broad and the space between 
letters -rV inch, thus making the "I" plus 
one space equal to \ inch or half the 
breadth of an "X." The "V's" should 
be the same breadth as the "X's." After 
the letters have been laid off in pencil, 
outline them with a ruling pen and fill 
in with a small camel's-hair brush, using 
gloss black paint thinned to the proper 
consistency to work well in the ruling 
pen. Using the ruling pen to outline the 
Fetters gives sharp straight edges, which 
it would be impossible to obtain with a 
brush in the hands of an inexperienced 
person. 

Verification of the Depthings.— In the 
verge watches, the English watches, and 
those of analogous caliber^ it is often 
difficult to verify the depthings, except 
by the touch. For this reason we often 
find the upper plate pierced over each 
depth. In the jeweled places instead of 
perforating the upper plate, it suffices to 
deoosit a drop of very hmpid oil on the 
rX taking care that it does not scatter. 
In this manner a lens is formed and ona 
may readily distinguish the depthing.

ved from wet and dirt When filtered 
the oil will be nearly colorless, perfectly 
limpid, and will never thicken or be- 
come rancid. 

To Weaken a Balance Spring— A bal- 
ance spring may need weakening; this is 
effected by grinding the spring thinner 
Remove the spring from the collet and 
place it upon a piece of pegwood cut to 
fit the center coil. A piece of soft iron 
wire, flattened so as to pass freely be- 
tween the coils and charged with a little 
powdered oilstone, will serve as a grinder, 
and with it the strength of the spring may 
soon be reduced. Operations will be con- 
fined to the center coil, f or no other part 
of the spring will rest sufficiently against 
the wood to enable it to be ground, but 
this will generally suffice. The effect will 
be rather rapid; therefore care should be 
taken or the spring may be made too 
weak. 

To Make a Clock Strike Correctly. — 
Pry the plates apart on the striking side, 
slip the pivots of the upper wheels out, 
and having disconnected them from the 
train, turn them partly around and put 
them back. If still incorrect, repeat the 
experiment. A few efforts at most will 
get them to work properly. The sound 
in cuckoo clocks is caused by a wire act- 
ing on a small bellows which is connected 
with two small pipes like organ pipes. 

To "Reblack Clock Hands. — One coat 
of asphaltum varnish will make old rusty 
hands look as good as new, and will dry 
in a few minutes. 



pm in aspi 

come hard in a few minutes and be much 
firmer and better than the gum shellac, 
generally used. 

To Loosen a Rusty Screw in a Watch 
Movement. — Put a little oil around the 
screw; heat the head lightly by means of 
a red-hot iron rod, applying the same for 
g or 3 minutes. The rusty screw may 
then be removed as easily as though it 
had just been put in. 

Gilding Watch Movements. (See alsc 
Gilding.) — In gilding watch movements, 
the greatest care must be observed with 
regard to cleanliness. The work is first 
to be placed into a weak solution of caustic 
potash for a few minutes, and then rinsed 
in cold water. The movements are now 
to be dipped into pickling acid (nitrous 
acid) for an instant, and then plunged 
immediately into cold water. After being 
finally rinsed in hot water, they may he 
placed in the gilding bath and allowed 
to remain therein until they have re- 
ceived the required coating. A few 
seconds will generally be sufficient, as 
this class of work does not require to be 
very strongly gilt. When gilt, the move- 
ments are to be rinsed in warm water, 
and scratch-brushed; they may then be 
returned to the bath, for an instant, to 
ive them a good color. Lastly, rinse 
hot water and place the movements 
in clean box sawdust. An economical 
mode of gilding watch movements is to 
employ a copper anode— working from 
the solution, add 10 parts of cream of 
tartar and a corresponding quantity^

P f fh i water cannot serve as a basis from

11 nf the components were put together 
many would V found insoluble, and 
Shers would form new chemical com- 
WnSons, so that the result would differ 
&y from the mineral water imitated. 

For example, carbonate of magnesia 
and carbonate of lime, which are im- 
portant ingredients m most mineral 
waters, will not make a clear solution 
unless freshly precipitated. Hence, 
when these are to be reproduced in a 
mineral water it is customary to employ 
other substances which will dissolve at 
once, and which will, upon combining^ 
produce these salts. The order m which 
the salts are added is also a very im- 
portant matter, for by dissolving the 
salts separately and then carefully com- 
bining them, solutions may be effected 
which would be impossible were all the 
salts added together to the water in the 
portable fountain.

Explanation, of Groups. — The explana- 
tion of the use of these groups is simple. 
"When about to prepare an artificial 
mineral water, first ascertain from the 
formula which of the ingredients belong 
to group 1 . These should be dissolved in 
water, and then be filtered and added to 
distilled water, and thoroughly agitated. 
Next the substance or substances be- 
longing to group 1 should be dissolved 
in water, then filtered and added to the 
water, which should again be agitated. 
\nd so the operation should proceed; 
whatever ingredients are required from 
each group should be taken in turn a 
solution made, and this solution, after 
being filtered, should be separately add- 
ed to the fountain, and the latter be well 
agitated before the following solution is 

ad For groups 1, 3, and 4, the salts should

P A question which arises in preparing 
mineral waters is: What is the best 
3a "in- pressure? As a general rule, they 
SSfrrged to a lower pressure than plain 
soda; good authorities even recommend 
charging certain mineral waters as low as 
30 pounas pressure to the square inch, but 
this seems much too low a pressure for 
the dispensing counter From 50 to 120 
pounds pressure would be a good limit, 
while plain soda may be served out as 
high as 180 pounds. There must be 
enough pressure completely to empty the 
fountain, while enabling sufficient gas to 
be retained by the water to give it a 
thorough pungency. Moreover, a high 
pressure to the mineral water enables a 
druggist at a pinch, when he runs outof 
plain soda, to use his Vichy water, in- 
stead, with the syruped drinks. The taste 
of the Vichy is not very perceptible when 
covered bythe syrup, and most custom- 
ers will not notice it.

Clarifying Muddy Water.— The water 
supply from rivers is so muddy at times 
S it will not go through the filter 
When this happens agitate each barrel 
of water with 2 pounds of phosphate of 
lime and allow it to settle This will 
take but a few minutes, and it will be 
found that most of the impurities have 
been carried down to the bottom. J. he 
water can then be drawn off carefully 
and filtered. 

Removal of Iron from Drinking 
Water.— The simplest method for re- 
moving the taste of iron in spring water 
is to pass the water through a filter con- 
taining a layer of tricalcic phosphate 
either in connection with other filtering 
materials or alone. The phosphate is 
first recovered in a gelatinous form, then 
dried and powdered. 

For Hardness. — A solution perfectly 
adapted to this purpose, and one which 
may be kept a long time, is prepared as 
follows: 

Thirty-five parts of almond oil an; 
mixed with 50 parts of glycerine of 
1.26 specific gravity and 8.5 parts of 50 
per cent soda lye, and boiled to saponifi- 
catiou. To this mixture, when it has 
cooled to from 85° to 90° C. (185° to 194° 
*■)» are added 100 to 125 parts of boiling 
wat er . After cooling again, 500 parts 
ot water are added, and the solution is 
Poured into a quart flask, with 94 per 
cent alcohol to make up a quart. After 
^andmg 2 months it is filtered. Twenty 
^yoroUraeter degrees of this solution 
yo*e, with 40 parts of a solution of 0.55 
grams of barium chloride in 1 quart of 
water, a dense lather 1 centimeter high. 



Waterproofing 



(See also Enamels, Glazes, Paints, 
Preservatives, Varnishes.) 

Waterproofing a Waxed Finish. — A 

waxed finish may he effectually protected 
against water or other form of moisture, 
by applying the following coating: Zanzi- 
bar copal varnish, boilerl linseed oil, and 
spirits of turpentine; six parts of each, 
by weight. Mix these together. 

Waterproofing Brick Arches —Water- 
proofing of brick arches is done in the 
following manner: The masonry is first 
smoothed over with cement mortar 
This is then covered with a spec: 
compound on which a layer of Hydi_. 
felt is laid so as to lap at least 12 inche 
on the transverse seams. Five layers o 
compound and 5 of felt are used, 
special attention is paid to seem 
tightness around the drain pipes and 
the spandTel walls. In fact the belt 
carried up the back of the latter am 
turned into the joint under the copm 
about 2 inches, where it is held wit 
cement mortar. The waterproofing - 
the arches is protected with 1 ™* 
cement mortar and that on the wa 
with a single course of brickwork.

Tn aDPly to a blue print, .spread one of 
tie saturated cloths on a smooth surface 
i w> the dry print on it with a second 
fi£d clot^on top, and iron with a 
I^tAv hot flatiron. The paper 
TmedHtely absorbs paraffine until sat- 
uTaTed becomes translucent and 

gShW 'waterproofed. The lines of the 
nnnt are intensified by the process, and 
tCe is no shrinking or distortion As 
the wax is withdrawn from the cloths 
£!« T can be added by melting small 
pieces directly under the iron. 
P Bv immersing the print in a bath ot 
melted paraffine the process is hastened, 
& ironing is necessary to remove 
*e surplus wax from the surface unless 
Se paper is to be directly exposed to the 
weather and not to be handled J he 
irons can be heated m most offices by 
ff as or over a lamp, and a supply ot 
saturated cloths obviates the necessity 
of the bath. This process, which was 
originally applied to blue prmt^ to be 
carried by the engineer corps in wet 
mines, is equally applicable to any kind 
of paper, and is convenient for water- 
iroofing typewritten or other notices to 
■e posted up and exposed to the weather. 



Waterproof Coatings. — I. — Rosin oil, 
50 parts; rosin, 30 parts; white soap, 
9 parts. Apply hot on the surfaces to be 
protected. 

II. — It has been observed that when 
;luten dried at an ordinary temperature, 
jence capable of absorbing water, is 
mixed with glycerine and heated, it 
becomes water-repelling and suitable for 
a waterproof paint. One part of gluten 
is mixed with \\ parts of glycerine, where- 
by a slimy mass is obtained which is ap- 
plied on fabrics subsequently subjected 
to a heat of 248° F. The heating should 
not last until all glycerine has evaporated, 
otherwise the coating becomes brittle and 
peels off. 

Waterproofing Canvas. — I. — The can- 
vas is coated with a mixture of the three 
solutions named below: 
; 1- Gelatin, 50 parts, by weight, boiled 
ni 3 1,000 parts of water free from lime, 
a. Alum, 100 parts, dissolved in 3,000 
parts of water. 3. Soda soap dissolved 
m 2,000 parts of water. 

H-~-Trepare a zinc soap by entirely 
dissolving 56 parts of soft soap in 125 to 
150 parts of water. To the boiling 
"quid add, with constant stirring, 28 to 
3vS parts of zme vitriol (white vitriol). 
ioe zinc soap floats on top and forms, 
£tter cooling, a hard white mass, which 
1 taken out. In. order to dean it of 



admixed carbonic alkali, it must hp 
melted in boiling fresh water 
place 232.5 parts of raw linseed oil (T 
from mucus) in a kettle with 2.5 part { 
best potash, and 5 parts of water. TV 
mass is boiled until it has become wh> 




and brown rosin, 10.5 parts. The whdP 
is boiled together about 1 hour, th 
temperature not being allowed to exceed 
212° F., and stirring well from tim e to 
time. After this add 15 parts of zinc soar, 
and stir the whole until the metal soal 
has combined with the oil, the tempera 
ture not exceeding 212° F. When the 
mixture is complete, add a solution of 
caoutchouc, 1.2 parts, and oil of turpen- 
tine, 8.56 parts, which must be well in- 
corporated by stirring. The material is 
first coated on one side by means of a 
brush with this composition, which must 
have a temperature of 158° F. There- 
upon hang it up to dry, then apply a 
second layer of composition possessing 
the same temperature, which is likewise 
allowed to dry. The fiber is now filled, 
out, so that the canvas is waterproof, 

Waterproofing Corkg. — For the pur- 
pose of making corks as impervious as 
possible, while at the same time keeping 
them elastic, saturate them with caout- 
chouc solution. Dissolve caoutchouc in 
benzine in the ratio of 1 part of caout- 
chouc to 19 parts of benzine. Into this 
liquid lay the corks to be impregnated 
and subject them to a pressure of 150 to 
180 pounds by means of a force pump, so 
that the liquid can thoroughly enter. 
The corks thus treated must next be ex- 
posed to a strong draught of air until all 
trace of benzine has entirely evaporatea 
and no more smell is noticeable. 

WATERPROOFING FABRICS, 

It will be convenient to divide water- 
proof fabrics into two classes, viz., w 
which are impervious to water, ana ^ 
which are water-repellent. _ It ' , 
portant to make this distinction, 
although all waterproof material is u 
for the purpose of resisting water, ^ 
is a vast difference between tw 
classes. The physical difference ^ 
tween them can be briefly sumrne u 
follows: Fabrics which are cOIup sk]nS , 
impervious to water comprise o . 
mackintoshes, and all materials 
a water-resisting film on one or bo ^ ose

chemical combination with sulphur, after 
which its elasticity is much increased; it 
will then bear far greater gradations of 
heat and cold. This chemical treatment 
of caoutchouc with sulphur is known as 
"vulcanizing," and, if properly carried 
out, will yield either soft vulcanized rub- 
ber or the hard variety known as vulcan- 
ite. On the other hand, caoutchouc, 
after vulcanizing, has lost its plastic 
nature, and can no longer be molded into 
various shapes, so that in the production 
of stamped or molded objects, the cus- 
tomary method is to form them in un- 
vulcanized rubber and then to vulcaniae 
them. 

Raw caoutchouc contains a number of 
natural impurities, such as sand, twigs, 
soil, etc.; these require removing before 
the manufacturing processes _ can be 
carried out. The first operation, after 
rough washing, is to shred the raw 
material into small strips, so as to en- 
able the impurities to be washed out. 
This process is carried out by pressing 
the rubber against the surface of a re- 
volving drum (A, Fig. 1), carrying 



erties are

'after going through the yarious man- 
ufacturine processes, and it ftas oniy 
a f ew of g the characteristics which are 
generally associated with India rubber 
themieallv it is a complex hydrocarbon 
with the formula C, 6 H se , and appears to 
consist of a highly porous network ot 
cells having several different rosms in 
their interstices. It is perfectly soluble 
in no single solvent, but will yield some 
of its constituents to many dlt J^™ 
solvents. At a temperature of 10 M> 
(50° F.) raw caoutchouc is a solid body 
and possesses very little elasticity. At 
36° C. (97° F.) it is soft and elastic to a 
high degree, and is capable of being 
stretched 16 times its length. Further 
increase of temperature lessens its elas- 
tic properties, and at 120° C. (248° f.) 
it melts. While in the raw condition 
it has several peculiar properties, one of 
which is: After stretching, and cooling 
suddenly while stretched, it retains its 
new form, and only regains its former 
shape on being warmed. Another strik- 
mg feature is its strong adhesive capacity; 
this property is so powerful that the 
rubber cannot be cut with a knife unless 
tae blade is wet; and freshly cut portions, 
11 Pressed together, will adhere and form 
a homog eileoils mass. From these facts 
« will be seen how it differs from rubber 
i u ™z shape of a cycle tire or other manu- 
factured form. 

The most valuable property possessed 
°y raw caoutchouc is that of entering into

The next operation, after well drying, 
is to thoroughly masticate the shredded 
rubber between hot steel rollers, which 
resemble those already described but 
usually have a screw-thread cut on their 
surfaces. Fig. 3 shows the front view

_ After passing several times through 
these, the rubber -will be in the form of 
Homogeneous strips, and is then ready 
either for molding or dissolving. As 
we are dealing solely with waterproofed 
textiles, the next process which concerns 
e dl I ssolyiIi g of the rubber in a 
2 V G solvent. Benzol, carbon bi- 
sulphide, oil of turpentine, ether, and 
absolve alcohol, ^ eac £ disSQ ' lv * °

tion. The agent commonly empl ' U ; 
is carbon bisulphide, together with in 
per cent of absolute alcohol. Whatev 



solvent is used, after being steeped i u l 
for some hours the caoutchouc swells out 
enormously, and then requires the addi 
tion of some other solvent to effect 3, 
complete solution. A general method is 
to place the finely shredded rubber in a 
closed vessel, to cover it with carbon 
bisulphide, and allow to stand for some 
hours. _ Toward the end of the time the 
vessel is warmed by means of a steam 
coil or jacket, and 10 parts absolute 
alcohol are added for every 100 parts of 
carbon bisulphide. The whole is then 
kept gently stirred for a few hours. Fig,

used for dissolving rubber. In this

is the tank containing the solution with 
an outlet at the bottom arranged so as

fabric passes slowly underneath this, re-

waterproofing. The two rollers at jB press 
the solution into the fabric and distrib- 
ute the proofing evenly over the entire 
surface. 

After leaving the two squeezing rollers, 
the cloth travels slowly through a covered 
chamber, 0, having a series of steam 
pipes, EE, underneath, to evaporate the 
solvent; this condenses on the upper por- 
tion of the chamber, which is kept cooled, 
and flows down the sides into suitable 
receptacles. After this the proofed cloth 
is vulcanized by passing round metal 
cylinders heated to the necessary temper- 
ature, or by passing through a heated 
I chamber, Fig. 7 shows the spreading of

the fabric and vulcanize it. Up to tnis 
stage the sulphur has only been mechan- 
ically mixed with the rubber; the aid ot 
heat is now required to bring about 
chemical combination between the two. 
This process, which is known as burn- 
ing," consists in subjecting the rubber-

Ever of dehydrated turpentine or what- 
ever solvent is used. All the sulphur m 
a rubber-proofed cloth is not in com- 
bination with the rubber; t is frequently 
found that, after a lapse of time, rubber- 
nroofed material shows an efflorescence 
of sulphur on the surface, due to excess 
of sulphur, and occasionally the fabric 
becomes stiff and the proofing scales oft. 
Whenever a large proportion of sulphur 
is present, there is always the danger of 
the rubbers forming slowly into the hard 
vulcanite state, as the substance com- 
monly called vulcanite consists only ot 
ordinary vulcanized rubber carried a 
stage further by more sulphur being 
used and extra heat applied. If after 
vulcanizing, rubber is treated with caus- 
tic soda, all this superfluous sulphur can 
be extracted; if it is then well washed 
the rubber will retain its elasticity for a 
long period. With the old methods of 
proofing, a sheet of vulcanized rubber 
was cemented to a fabric with rubber 
varnish, and frequently this desulphuriz- 
ing was performed before cementing to- 
gether. The result was a flexible and 
durable cloth, but of great weight and 
thickness, and expensive to produce. 

The chemistry of rubber is very little 
understood; as mentioned previously, 
rubber is a highly complex body, liable 
to go through many changes. These 
changes are likely to be greater in rub- 
ber varnish, consisting of half a dozen or 
more ingredients, than in the case of 
rubber alone. The action of sunlight 
has a powerful effect on rubber, much 
to its detriment, and appears to increase 
lts tendency to oxidize. Vulcanized 
rubber keeps its properties better under 
water than when exposed to the air, and 
changes more slowly if kept away from 
tne light. _ It appears as though a slight 
decomposition always takes place even 
with pure rubber; but the presence of so 
many differently constituted substances

tlll£ number 5> f different bodies with

compositions, it « only reasonable to 



expect there will be some moleeul ar rft 
arrangement going on in the mass- an* 
this can be assigned as the reason w v. 
some proofings last as long acrain 
others. Some metallic salts have a ver S 
injurious action on rubber, one of +h 
worst being copper sulphate. Dyers ar 
frequently warned that goods for rubbed 
proofing must be free from this metal" 
as its action on rubber is very powerful' 
though but little understood. As is 
generally known, grease in any form is 
exceedingly destructive to rubber, and it 
should never be allowed in contact in 
the smallest proportion. Some composi- 
tions are made up by dissolving rubber 
in turpentine and coal tar; but in this 
case some of the rubber's most valuable 
properties are destroyed, and it is doubt- 
ful if it can be properly vulcanized. 
Owing to rubber being a bad conductor 
of heat, it requires considerable care to 
vulcanize it in any thickness. A high 
degree of heat applied during a short 
period would tend to form a layer of 
hard vulcanite on the surface, while that 
immediately below would be softer and 
would gradually merge into raw rubber 
in the center. 

The different brands of rubber vary 
so much, especially with regard to solu- 
bility, that it is always advisable to treat 
each brand by itself, and not to make a 
solution of two or more kinds. Oilskins 
and tarpaulins, etc., are mostly proofed 
by boiled linseed oil, with or without 
thickening bodies added. They are 
not of sufficient interest to enlarge upon 
in this article, so the second, or "water- 
repellent," class has now to be dealt with. 

All the shower-proof fabrics come 
under this heading, as well as every clotn 
which is pervious to air and repulsive to 
water. The most time-honored recipe 
for proofing woollen goods is a ^ tu ^ 
of sugar of lead and alum, and dates 
back hundreds of years. The system <* 
using this is as follows: two ^ing«^

for moisture that in a shower of rain the 
drops remain in a spheroidal state, and 
fall off. Iu a strong wind, or under pres- 
sure, water eventually penetrates through 
fabrics proofed in this manner; but they 
will effectually resist a shaip shower. 
Unfortunately, shower-proofed goods, 
with wear, gradually lose this property 
«f repelling water. The equation repre- 
senting the change between alum and 
sugar of lead is given below. In the case 
of common alum there would, of course, 
be potassium acetate in solution besides 
the alumina.

range of waterproof compositions can be 
got by using stearates of the metals; 
these, m nearly every case, are insoluble 
bodies, and when deposited in the in- 
t 4 e i"°. r of a fabric form a water-resisting 
falling which is very effective. As a 
rule these stearates are deposited on the 
material by means of double baths; for 
example, by passing the fabric through 
(say) a bath of aluminum acetate, and 
then, after squeezing out the excess of 
liquid, passing it through a bath of soap. 
The aluminum salt on the fabric de- 
composes the soap, resulting in a deposit 
of insoluble stearate of alumina. This 
system of proofing in two baths is clean- 
er and more economical than adding all 
the ingredients together, as the stearate 
formed is just where it is required "on 
the fibers," and not at the bottom of the 
bath. 

One of the most important patents 
now worked for waterproofing purposes 
is on the lines of the old alumina process. 
In this case the factor used is rosin, 
dissolved in a very large bulk of petro- 
leum spirit. The fabrics to be proofed 
(usually dress materials) are passed 
through a bath of this solution, and 
carefully dried to drive off the solvent. 
Following this, the goods are treated by 
pressing with hot polished metal rollers. 
This last process melts the small quan- 
titv of rosin, which is deposed on the 
cloth, and leaves each single fiber witii 
an exceedingly thin film of rosm on it. 
It wS be understood that only a very 
attenuated solution of rosin is per- 
missible, so that the fibers of the tnreaas 
Sid not .he threads themselves are coated

WATERPROOFING 



This is done by means of a roller, A, 
running in the proofing solution, the 
Serifl to be coated traveling slowly 
over the top and just in contact with the 
roller A, which transfers the proofing 
to it Should the solution used be of a 
thick nature, then a smooth metal, roller 
will transfer sufficient to the fabric- It 
The reverse is the case, and the hquid 
used is very thin, then the roller is 
covered with felt, which very materially 
adds to its carrying power. As shown in 
9, after leaving the two squeezing 
rollers BB, the fabric passes slowly 
round a large steam-heated cylinder^ L 
with the coated side uppermost. Ibis 
dries the proofing and fastens it, and the 
cloth is taken off at D. 

Besides stearates of the metals, glues 
and gelatins have been used for pr Dol- 
ing purposes, but owing to their stiffen- 
ing effect, they are only of use in some 
few isolated cases. With glue and 
gelatin the fixing agent is either tannic 
acid or some metallic salt. _ Tannic 
acid converts gelatin into an insoluble 
leather-like body; this can be deposited 
in the interstices of the fabric by passing 
the latter through a gelatin bath first, 
and then squeezing and passing through 
the tannic acid. Bichromate of potash 
also possesses the property of fixing the 
proteid bodies and rendering them in- 
soluble. 

The following are special processes 
used to advantage in the manufacture of 
waterproof fabrics: 

% — Ordinary Fabrics, Dressing Ap- 
parel, etc. — Immerse in a vat of acetate 
of alumina (5° Be.) for 12 hours, lift, dry, 
and let evaporate at a temperature of 
from 140° to 149° F. 

II. — Sailcloth, Awnings, Thick Blank- 
ets, etc. — Soak in a 7 per cent solution of 
gelatin at 104° F., dry, pass through a 
4. per. cent solution of alum, dry again, 
rinse in water, and dry. 

III. — Fabrics of Cotton, Linen, Jute, 
and Hemp. — Put into a bath of am- 
moniacal cupric sulphate of 10° Be. at a 
temperature of 87° F. ; let steep thorough- 
ly, then put in a bath of caustic soda 
(20° Be.) and dry. To increase the im- 
permeability, a bath of sulphate of al- 
umina may be substituted for the caustic- 
soda bath. 

IV —Saturate the fabrics with the fol- 
lowing odorless compound, subjecting 
them several times to a brushing machine 
Laving several rollers, where the warp 
threads will be well smoothed, and a 
waterproof product of fine sheen and 
scarcely fading will be the result. Tb e 



compound is made with 30 parts, by 
weight, of Japan wax, 22^ parts, by 
weight, of paraffine, 12 parts, by weight, 
of rosin soap, 35 parts, by weight, of 
starch, and 5 parts, by weight, of a 5 

per 

cent solution of alum. I abrics thus pre- 
pared are particularly adapted to the 
manufacture of haversacks, shoes, etc. 

V. — White or Light Fabrics. — P aas 
first through a bath of acetate of alumina 
of 4° to 5° Be. at a temperature of 104° F., 
then through the rollers to. rid of all 
liquid; put into a warm solution of soap 
(5 parts, by weight, of olive-oil soap to 
100 parts, by weight, of fresh water) and 
finally pass through a 2 per cent solution 
of alum, dry for 2 or 3 days on the drop- 
ping horse, and brush off all particles of 
soap. 

VI. — Dissolve 1\ parts, by weight, of 
gelatin in 50 parts, by weight, of boil- 
ing water, add 1£ parts, by weight, of 
scraped tallow soap and %\ parts, by 
weight, of alum, the latter being put in 

gradually; lower the temperature of the 
ath to 122° F., lift out the fabric, dry, 
and calender. 

VII. — Tent Cloth. — Soak in a warm 
solution of 1 part, by weight, of gelatin, 
1 part, by weight, of glycerine, and 1 
part, by weight, of tannin in 12 parts, 
by weight, of wood vinegar (pyrohgne- 
ous acid) of 12° Be. The whole is 
melted in a kettle and carefully mixed. 
The mass is poured into the receiver of 
the brushing machine, care being taken 
to keep it liquid. For a piece of 500 
feet in length and 20 inches in width, 
50 to SO parts, by weight, of this com-| 
pound are needed. 

VIIL— To freshen worn waterproof 
material, cover with the following: Iifty- 
five thousand parts, by weight, of gelatin; 
100 parts, by weight, of bichromate « 
potash; 100 parts, by weight, of acetic 
acid (to keep glue from congealing), ana 
from 3,000 to 5,000 parts, by weight, oi 
water; to this add 500 parts, by weigi". 
of peroxide of am moniacal copper, iwm 
Be. This compound is put on the tabrij 
with a brush and then exposed to air a 
light. x

The fabric is put into a soap solution 
(5 parts of good Marseilles soap in 100 
parts of soft water). Finally it is put 
through a 2 per cent alum solution, and 
left to dry for 2 or 3 days on racks. The

as follows: Thirty parts, by weight, of 
Japanese wax; 22.5 parts, by weight, of 
paraffinc; 15 parts, by weight, of rosin 
soap; 35 parts, by weight, of starch, and 5 
parts, by weight, of a 5 per cent alum solu- 
tion. The first three components are 
melted in a kettle, the starch and, lastly, 
the alum added, and the whole slirred 
vigorously. 

XVII. — One hundred parts, by weight, 
of castor oil are heated to nearly 204° F., 
with 50 parts, by weight, of caustic 
potash, of 50° Be., to which 50 parts, by 
weight, of water have previously been 
added. Forty parts, by weight, of 
cooler water are then added slowly, care 
being taken to keep the temperature of 
the mixture constant. As soon as the 
liquor begins to rise, 40 parts, by weight, 
of cooler water are again added, with the 
same precaution to keep the temperature 
from falling below 204° F. At the same 
time care must be taken to prevent the 
liquor boiling, as this would produce too 
great saponification. By the prolonged 
action of heat below the boiling point, 
the oil absorbs water and caustic potash 
without being changed, and the whole 
finally forms a perfectly limpid, nearly 
black liquid. This is diluted with 5 
times its weight of hot or cold watered

XXI A favorite method for cloth is 

as follows: Dissolve in a receptacle, 
preferably of copper, oyer a bright coal 
fire, 1 liter (1.76 pints) of pure lmseed oil, 
liter (1.76 pints) of petroleum, } liter 
,„.88 pints) of oil turpentine, and 12 c 
erams (4.37 ounces) of yellow wax, the 



1 liter (1-76 pints; oi petrwuum, - 
(0.88 pints) of oil turpentine, and 125 
grams (4.37 ounces) of yellow wax, the 
fast named in small bits. As there is 
danger of fire, boiling of this mass should 
be avoided. With this hot solution re- 
moved from the fire, of course the felt 
material is impregnated; next it is hung 
up in a warm, dry room or spread out, 
but in such a manner that the uniform 
temperature can act upon all parts. 

"Waterproofing Leather. — I. — Ten- 
mag's process is as follows: Melt together 
equal parts of zinc and linseed oil, at a 
temperature not above 225° F. Put the 
leather in the molten mixture and let it 
remain until saturated. The "zinc soap" 
is made by dissolving 6 parts of white 
soap in 16 parts of water, and stirring 
into the solution 6 parts of zinc sulphate. 
To make sure of a homogeneous mixture 
remelt the whole and stir until it begins 
to cool. The process, including the satu- 
ration of the leather, requires about 48 
hours. Instead of zinc sulphate, copper 
or iron sulphate may be used. The phi- 
losophy of the process is that the mois- 
ture and air contained in the pores of the 
leather arc driven out by the heat of the 
soap mixture, and their place is taken, on 
cooling, by the mixture. The surface of 
the leather is scraped after cooling, and 
the article is dried, either by heating over 
an open fire or by hanging in a drying 
room, strongly heated. 

II; — Prideaux* process consists in sub- 
mitting the leather to treatment with a 



solution of caoutchouc until it is tho r . 
oughly saturated with the liquid. The 
latter consists of 30 parts of caoutchouc 
in 500 parts of oil of turpentine. Com- 
plete impregnation of the leather re- 
quires several days, during which the 
solution must be frequently applied to 
the surface of the leather and rubbed in. 

HI. — Villon's process consists in ap- 
plying a soap solution to the leather, 
about as fallows: The leather is first 
treated to a solution of 62 parts of soap, 
lg4 parts of glue, and 2,000 parts of 
water. "When it has become saturated 
with the solution, it is treated to rubbing 
with a mixture of 460 parts of common 
salt and 400 parts of alum, in sufficient 
water to dissolve the same. Alter this it 
is washed with tepid water and dried. 
This process is much the quickest. The 
application of the soap requires about 
2 hours, and the subsequent treat- 
ment about as much more, or 4 or 5 hour 
in all. 

Oilskins. — The art of painting ov 
textile fabrics with oily preparations to 
make them waterproof is probably near! 
as old as textile manufacture itself, a 
industry of prehistoric, nay, geologic, 
origin. It is certainly more ancient than 
the craft of the artistic painter in oils, whose 
canvases are nothing more nor less tba 
art oilskins, and when out of their frames, 
have served the usual purpose of thos 
things in protecting goods or the huma 
body before now. The art of water 
proofing has been extended beyond th 
domain of the oilskin by chemic- 
processes, especially those m which alum 
or lead salts, or tannin, are used, as well 
as by the discovery of India rubber ana 
gutta percha. These two have revolu- 
tionized the waterproofing industry m 
quite a special manner, and the o u3 *l 
manufacture, although it still exists ana 
is in a fairlv flourishing condition, nas 
found its products to a very largo exter

result has been that the processes usea ■

K waterproofing method is to im- 
pregnate the fabric with a mixture of 
fard paraffine and boiled oil m propor- 
tions Varying according to circum- 
stances from 95 per cent of paraffine and 
5 of oil to 70 per cent of the former and 
30 of the latter. The most usual per- 
centages are 80 and 20. The mixture is 
made with the aid of heat, and is then 
cast into blocks for storage. It is ap- 
plied to the cloth stretched on a hot plate 
by rubbing the fabric thoroughly all 
over with a block of the composition, 
■which may be applied on one or both 
.. sides as may be wished. The saturation 
is then made complete, and excess of 
composition is removed by passing the 
cloth between hot rollers". When the 
cloth is quite cold the process is com- 
i plete._ The paraffine and the drying oil 
combine their waterproofing powers, and 
I tie paraffine prevents the oil from ex- 
\ ernT1 g any injurious action upon the 
■ material. Drying oil, partly on account 
°i the metallic compounds in it, and 
I partly on account of its absorbing oxygen

r?^ foll °wing are some of the best 
sEa? mended recipes for making oil- 



. P-'— Take fine twilled calico, 
it m bullock's blood and dry it. Then 
give it 2 or 3 coats of boiled oil, mixed 
with a little litharge, or with an ounce of 
gold size to every pint of the oil. 

Ill-— Make ordinary paint ready to 
be applied thin with a strong solution of 
soap. 

IV. — Make 96 pounds of ocher to a 
thin paste with boded oil, and then add 
16 pounds of ordinary black paint mixed 
ready for use. Apply the first coat of 
this with soap, the subsequent coats 
without soap. 

V. — Dissolve rosin in hot boiled oil 
till it begins to thicken. 

VI. — Mix chalk or pipe clay in the 
finest powder, and in the purest state 
obtainable to a thin paste with boiled oil. 

VII. — Melt together boiled oil, 1 pint; 
beeswax and rosin, each, S ounces. 

VIII. — Dissolve soft soap in hot water 
and add solution of protosulphate of 
iron till no further precipitate is produced. 
Filter off, wash, and dry, and form the 
mass into a thin paste with boiled oil. 

All these compositions are painted on 
with an ordinary painter's brush. The 
fabric should be slightly stretched, both 
to avoid folds and to facilitate the pene- 
tration of the waterproofing mixture, lo 
aid the penetration still further, the

S mdpy material leaves the Foudnmer

Ep condition, bnt with the larger pe - 
renH»e of moisture removed. From this 
no nt the treatment of the paper is the 
fame whether it be pulp in a sheet, as 
above stated, or fimsW paper 

The treatment consists, first, in satu- 
rating the paper with glutinous ' matoad, 
preferably animal glue, and by pretcrence 
the bath of glutinous material should be 
hot to effect the more rapid absorption 
and more perfect permeation, impregna- 
tion, and deposit of the glutinous ma- 
terial within all the microscopic inter- 
stices throughout the body of the paper 
being treated. By preference a suitable 
tank is provided in which the glutin- 
ous material is deposited, and in which 
it may be kept heated to a constant 
temperature, the paper being passed 
through the tank and saturated during 
its passage. The material being treated 
should pass in a continuous sheet— that 
is, be fed from a roll and the finished 
product be wound in a roll after final 
treatment. This saves time and the 
patentee finds that the requisite permea- 
tion or incorporation of glutinous mat- 
ter in the fiber will with some papers 
— for instance, lightly sized manila 
hemp — require but a few seconds. As 
the paper passes from the glutin tank 
the surplus of the glutinous matter is 
removed from the surface by mechani- 
cal means, as contradistinguished from 
simply allowing it to pass off by gravity, 
and in most instances it is preferred to 
pass the paper between siutable pres- 
sure rolls to remove such surplus. The 
strength and consistency of the glutinous 
bath may be varied, depending upon the 
material, being treated and the uses for 
which such material is designed. It 
may, however, be stated that, in a ma- 
jority of cases, a hot solution of about 
1 part of animal glue to about 10 parts of 
water, by weight, gives the best results. 
After leaving the bath of glutinous ma- 
terial and having the surplus adhering 
to the surfaces removed, the paper be- 
fore drying is passed into or through 
a solution of formaldehyde and water 
to set" the glutinous material. The 
strength of this solution may also be 
variable, depending, as heretofore stated, 
upon the paper and uses for which it is 
designed. fn the majority of eases, 
However, a solution of 1 part of formalde- 



hyde (35 per cent solution) to 5 parts ot 
water, by weight, gives good results, arid, 
the best result is attained if this bath is 
cold instead of hot, though any particu- 
lar temperature is not essentially neces- 
sary. The effect of tiie formaldehyde 
solution upon the glutin-saturated paper 
is to precipitate the glutinous matter and 
render it insoluble. 

As the material comes from the formal- 
dehyde bath, the surplus adhering to 
the surfaces is removed by mechanical 
means, pressure rolls being probably 
most convenient. The paper is then dried 
in any convenient manner. The best 
result in drying is attained by the air- 
blast, i. e., projecting blasts of air against 
both surfaces of the paper. This drying 
removes all the watery constituents "and 
leaves the paper in a toughened or 
greatly strengthened condition, but not 
in practical condition for commercial 
uses, as it is brittle, horny, and stiff, and 
has an objectionable odor and taste 
on account of the presence of the alde- 
hydes, paraldehydes, formic acid, and 
other products, the result of oxidation. 
Hence it needs to be "tempered." Now 
while the glutinous material is rendered 
insoluble — that is, it is so acted upon by 
formaldehyde and the chemical action 
which takes place while the united solu- 
tions are giving off their watery constit- 
uents that it will not fully dissolve— it 
is, however, in a condition to be acted 
on by moisture, as it. will swell and ab- 
sorb, or take up permanently by either 
chemical or mechanical action a per- 
centage of water, and will also become 
improved in many respects, so that to 
temper and render the paper soft and 
pliable and adapt it for most com- 
mercial uses it is subjected to moisture, 
which penetrates the paper, causing a 
welling in all directions, filling 
interstices perfectly and resulting m 
"hydration" throughout the entire cel- 
lular structure. Two actions, mechanical 
and chemical, appear to take place, i 
mechanical action being the temporary 
absorption of water analogous to tno ^ 
sorption of water by a dry sponge, 
chemical action being the P e ^ ma ° e J

a disagreeable taste and may carry 
traces of acids, rendering it impracti- 
cable for some uses — for instance, wrap- 
ping butter, meats, cheese, etc., after 
receiving the alkali treatment. The 
paper is also valuable as a packing for 
joints in steam, water, and other pipes or 
connections. For the purpose, there- 
fore, of rendering the material absolutely 
free from all traces of acidity and all 
taste and odors and, in fact, to render it 
absolutely hygienic, it is passed through 
a bath of water and a volatile alkali (am- 
monium hydrate), the proportion by pref- 
erence in a majority of cases being one- 
hundredth of ammonium hydrate to 
ninety-nine one-hundredths of water by 
volume. A small percentage of wood 
alcohol may be added. This bath is 
Preferably cool, but a variation in its 
temperature will not interfere to a seri- 
ous extent with the results. The effect of 
"jis bath followed by drying is to com- 
allt the ctemica l reaction and dest". oy

gemc in all respects. The material may

to its component integrate structure will 
be practically non-conductive to elec 
tncity, adapting it as a superior insu- 
lating material. It may with perfect safety 
be employed for wrapping butter, meats, 
spices, groceries, and all materials, whether 
unctuous or otherwise. 
t The term "hydration" means the sub- 
jecting of the material (after treatment 
with glutinous material and formalde- 
hyde and drying) to moisture, whereby 
the action described takes place. 

A sheet or web of paper can be treated 
by the process as rapidly as it is manu- 
factured, as the time for exposure to the 
action of the glutinous material need not 
be longer than the time required for it to 
become saturated, this, of course, vary- 
ing with different thicknesses and 
densities, and the length of time of ex- 
posure may be fixed without checking 
the speed by making the tank of such 
length that the requisite time will elapse 
while the sheet is passing through it and 
the guides so arranged as to maintain the 
sheet in position to be acted on by such 
solution the requisite length of time. 
Four seconds' exposure to the action o? 
formaldehyde is found sufficient in most 
cases. 

"Waterproof Ropes.— For making ropes
