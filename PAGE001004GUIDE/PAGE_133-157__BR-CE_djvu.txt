Drawing Temper from Brass.— Brass

3« to be tempered the material must 
ff prepared before the article is shaped. 
Temper may be drawn from brass by 
heating it to' a cherry red and then sim-

though steel were to be tempered. 

BREWING BEER: 

Beer is produced by the alcoholic fer- 
mentation of a mixture of malted barley 
and hops. 

Barley is steeped in water to soften 
the husk and to make the grain Teady for 
the sprouting process. The moist grains 
are set aside for about eight days during 
which time sprouting takes place. 

The grains are then dried and ground 
to a coarse powder. 

The powder is placed in a mash tub 
and live steam is applied to it. This 
converts the starch into maltose and 
other sugars, This liquid which is called 
wort is heated, for several hours and 
during this time hops are added. The 
hops give the beer its bitter taste. 

The solution is drawn off from the 
solid matter and cooled. 
_ Yeast is now added and the fermenta- 
tion which begins almost immediately is 
allowed to continue for about 10 to 12 
days depending upon the termperature. 

The beer is then aged for several 
Months and finally the clear product is 
drawn off from the sediment and bottled.

f on- sum water or ismglass, and laid 
SKr&i a brush or pencil, almost but not 
absolutely dry. A piece ot soft leather, 
wrapped around the finger, is dipped into 
the powder and rubbed over the work; 
when all this has been covered with the 
bronze it must be left to dry, and the 
loose powder is then cleared away with 
a hair pencil. 

LIQUID BRONZES. 

Liquid Bronzes.— I.— Pot the produc- 
tion of liquid bronze, acid-free varnish 
should be used, as bronze ground with 
ordinary varnish will form verdigris. 
For the" deacidification of dammar rosin 
pour 1,000 parts of petroleum benzine 
over 350 parts of finely ground dammar 
rosin, and dissolve by repeated shaking. 
Next add to the solution 250 parts of a 
10-pcr-cent aqueous solution of caustic 
soda and shake up well for 10 minutes. 
After standing for a short time two 
strata will have formed, the upper one 
consisting of benzine-rosin solution and 
the lower, aqueous one containing the 
resinic aeid dissolved as soda salts. Pour 
°tt the benzine layers and agitate again 
assiduously with 250 parts of the 10-per- 
wnt caustic-soda solution. Now set 
asj de for a complete classification and 
reparation of the two liquids. The 
J a mm ^ solution siphoned off will be per- 
fectly tree from acid. To obtain gold- 
™onze varnish add to the deaeidified 
amm ar solution about 250 parts of 
Br ^e or brocade per liter.

III.— A liquid bronze, which, whil 
it contains no metallic constituent, ye 
possesses a metallic luster and a bronz 
appearance, and answers excellently fo 
many purposes, is made as follows 
Dissolve by the aid of gentle heat 1 
parts of aniline red and 5 parts of anilin 
purple in 100 parts of alcohol. Whe 
solution is complete, add 5 parts of be 
zoic acid, raise the heat, and let he

clear bronze brown. For "marbling

BRONZING 



with a 
tronzed piece 

St H— If the article is of brass it must 
be given a coat of copper by means of 
theStery. Next dip a brush m olive 
oil and brush the piece uniformly; let 
dry for 5 or 6 hours and place in saw- 
dust. Then heat the article on a mod- 
erate charcoal dust fire. 

Preparation of French Bronze.— 
French bronze may be prepared by re- 
ducing to a powder hematite, 5 parts, 
and plumbago, S parts, and mixing into a 
paste with spirit of wine. Apply the 
composition with a soft brush to the 
article to be bronzed and set it aside for 
some hours. By polishing with a toler- 
ably hard brush the article will assume 
the beautiful appearance of real bronze. 
The desired tint may be regulated by the 
proportions of the ingredients. 

How to Bronze Metals.— Prepare a 
solution of lh ounces of sodium hyposul- 
pnite in 1 pint of water and add to the 
same a solution of li ounces of lead 
acetate dissolved in 1 pint of water. 

If, instead of lead acetate, an equal 
weight of sulphuric acid (1$ ounces) is 
added to the sodium hyposulphite and 
the process carried on as before, the 
brass becomes coated with a very beau- 
tiful red, which changes to green, and 
finally a splendid brown with a green 
and red iridescence. This last is a very 
durable coating and may be especially 
recommended. It is very difficult to 
dbtain exact shades by this process with- 
out some experience. The thorough 
cleansing of all articles from grease by 
boiling in potash is absolutely necessary 
to success. By substituting other metal 
salts for the lead acetate many changes 
m tints and quality of the coatings can 
also be effected. 

When this mixture is heated to a tem- 
perature a little below the boiling point 
it precipitates sulphide of lead in a state 
of tine division. If some metal is pres- 
ent some of the lead is precipitated on 
the surface and, according to the thick- 
ness of the layer, different colors are pro- 
duced. To produce an even color the 
articles must be evenly heated. By im- 
mersion of brass articles for 5 minutes

in the solution and the temperature useri 
Iron objects treated in this solution tak 
a steel-blue colur, zinc a brown color I 6 
the case of copper objects a golden yellow 
cannot be obtained. 

New Bronzing Liquid.— Dissolve 1(V 
parts of fuchsme and 5 parts of aniline 
purple in 100 parts of alcohol (95 percent) 
and add to the solution 5 parts of ben- 
zoic acid. Boil the whole for 10 min- 
utes until the color turns bronze brown. 
This liquid can be applied to all metals 
and dries quickly. 

A Bronze for Brass. — Immerse the 
articles, freed from dirt and grease, in a 
cold solution of 10 parts of potassium 
permanganate, 50 parts of iron sulphate, 
5 parts of hydrochloric acid in 1,000 
parts of water. Let remain 30 seconds, 
then withdraw, rinse, and let dry in fine, 
soft sawdust. If the articles have be- 
come too dark, or if a reddish-brown 
color be desired, immerse for about 1 
minute in a warm (140° F.) solution of 
chromic acid, 10 parts; hydrochloric 
acid, 10 parts; potassium permanganate, 
10 parts; iron sulphate, .50 parts; water, 
1,000 parts. Treat as before. If the 
latter solution alone be used the product 
will be a brighter dark-yellow or red- 
dish-brown color. By heating in a dry- 
ing oven the tone of the colors is im- 
proved. 

To Bronze Copper,— This process is 
analogous to the one practiced at the 
Mint of Paris for bronzing medals.

Bronze Gilding on Smooth Moldings.— 
A perfect substitute for dead gilding can- 
not be obtained by bronzing, because of 
the radically different reflection of the 
light, for the matt gilding presents to the 
light" a perfectly smooth surface, while 
in bronzing every little scale of bronze 
reflects the light in a different direction. 
In consequence of this diffusion of light, 
all bronzing, even the best executed, is 
somewhat darker and dimmer than leaf 
gilding. This dimness, it is true, ex- 
tends over the whole surface, and there- 
fore is not perceptible to the layman, and 
cannot be called an evil, as the genuine 
leaf gold is so spotted that a bronzed 
surface is cleaner than a gilt one. The 
following process is the best known at 
present: Choose only the best bronze, 
which is first prepared thick with pure 
spirit. Next add a quantity of water 
and stir again. After the precipitation, 
which occurs promptly, the water is 
poured off and renewed repeatedly by 
fresh water. When the spirit has been 
washed out again in this manner, the re- 
naming deposit, i. e., the bronze, is 
thinned with clean, good gold size. The 
Dr onze must be thin enough just to 
cover. The moldings are coated twice, 
the second time commencing at the op- 
posite end. Under no circumstances 
should the dry, dead gilding give off 
colo r when grasping it firmly. It it does 
Pat, either the size is inferior or the so- 
ut iou too weak or the mixture too thick.

Bronzing Engraved Ornaments.' 

Take bronze and stir with it pale copal 
varnish diluted one-half with turpentine 
With this paint the ornaments neatly! 
In $ hour the bronze will have dried. 
The places from which the bronze is to 
be removed, L e., where the bronze has 
overrun the polished surface, are dabbed 
with a small rag soaked with kerosene, 
taking care that it is not too wet, so as 
to prevent the kerosene from running 
into the ornament. After a short whik- 
the bronze will have dissolved and cai 
be wiped off with a soft rag. If thk 
does not remove it entirely, dab and wipt 
again. Finally finish wiping with a' 
especially soft, clean rag. Kerosei 
does not attack polish on wood. TL_ 
bronze must become dull and yet adhere 
firmly, under which condition it has a 
hardened color. If it does not become 
dull the varnish is too strong and shoubf 
be diluted with turpentine.

BRONZE COLORING: 

To Color Bronze. — Bronze articles ac- 
quire handsome tempering colors by 
heating. In order to impart an old ap- 
pearance to new objects of bronze, they 
may be heated over a flame and rubbed 
with a woolen rag dipped in finely pow- 
dered graphite, until the desired shade 
is attained. Or else a paste is applied 
on the article, consisting of graphite 5 
parts and bloodstone 15 parts, with a suf- 
ficient quantity of alcohol. After 24 
hours brush off the dry powder. A hot 
solution composed of sal ammoniac 4 
parts, sorrel salt I part, vinegar 200 
parts, may also be brushed on. Another 
way is to dip the pieces into a boiling so- 
lution of cupric acetate 20 parts, and sal 
ammoniac 10. parts, dissolved in 60 to 
100 parts of vipegar. 

Patent bronzes (products colored by 
means of aniline dyes) have hitherto 
been used in the manufacture of toys and 
d£ luxe or fancy paper, but makers of 
wall or stained paper have recently given 
their attention to these products. Wall 
—or moire — paper prepared with these 
dyes furnishes covers or prints of silken 
gloss with a peculiar double-color effect 
in which the metallic brilliancy charac- 
teristic of bronze combines with the 
shade? of the tar pigments used. Very

by pressing the paper lengths or ? 
painted with amhne-bronze dyes t£ 
brass brocade and tin bronzes ser 
bases for the aniline dyes; of the ta^ ,aS 
ments only basic aniline dyes soluK 
alcohol are used. In coloring the n 1 
verized bronze care must be taken ffi 
the latter is as free as possible from 
ganic fats. Tar dyes should be 
solved in as concentrated a form as no 
sible in alcohol and stirred with the 
bronze, the pigment being then fixed on 
the vehicle with an alcoholic solution of 
tannin. The patent bronze is then 
dried by allowing the alcohol to evapo- 
rate. This method of coloring is purely 
mechanical, as the tar dyes do not com- 
bine with the metallic bronze, as is the 
case with pigments in which hydrate oi 
alumina is used. A coating of aniline 
bronze of this kind is therefore very sen- 
sitive to moisture, unless spread over 
the paper surface with a suitable protect- 
ive binding medium, or protected by a 
transparent coat of varnish, which of 
course must not interfere with the special 
color effect.

painting it with a solution of 4 parts of 
sal ammoniac and 1 part of oxalium 
(oxalate of potash) in 200 parts of vine- 
gar, allowing it to dry, and repeating the 
operation several times. These articles, 
protected against rain, soon lose the un- 
pleasant glaring metallic luster and as- 
sume instead a soft brown tint, which 
bronze articles otherwise acquire only 
after several years' exposure to the at- 
mosphere. A beautiful bronze color

be imparted to bronze articles by the 
iollowing process: The object is first 
washed in a solution of 1 part of crystal- 
lized verdigris and 2 parts of sal ammo-

before an open fire till the green color

Gold and Silver Bronze Powders 
Genuine gold bronze is produced ?™ 
the waste and parings offid in £33 
beating. The parings, etc., are ground 
with honey or a gum solution, Son a 
glass plate or under hard granite stone* 
into a very fine powder, which is S 
peatedly washed out with water and 
dried. There are various shades of sold 
bronze, viz., red, reddish, deep yellow 
pale yellow, as well as greenish. These 
tints are caused by the various percent- 
ages of gold or the various mixtures of 
the gold with silver and copper. 

By the use of various salt solutions or 
acidulated substances other shades can 
be imparted to bronze. In water con- 
taining sulphuric acid, nitric acid, or 
hydrochloric acid, it turns a bright yel- 
low; by treatment with a solution of crys- 
tallized verdigris or blue vitriol in watei 
it assumes more of a reddish hue; other 
tints are obtained with the aid of cooking 
salt, tartar, green vitriol, or saltpeter in 
water. 

Gold bronze is also obtained by dis- 
solving gold in aqua rcgia and mixing 
with a solution of green vitriol in water 
whereupon the gold falls down as a me- 
tallic powder which may be treated ir, 
different ways. The green vitriol, how- 
ever, must be dissolved in boiling water 
and mixed in a glass, drop by drop, witl 
sulphuric acid and stirred until the basi 
iron sulphate separating in flakes has re 
dissolved. Another way of producing 
gold bronze is by dissolving gold m aqua 
regia and evaporating the solution in a 
porcelain dish. When it is almost dry 
add a little pure hydrochloric acid and 
repeat this to drive out all the free chlo- 
rine and to produce a pure nydrochlorak

Mosaic Gold.— Mosaic gold, generally 
a Sound of tin. 64.63 parts, and sul- 
Shur 35.37 parts, is odorless and taste- 
Jew and dissolves only in chlorine solu- 
tion, aqua regia, and toil ng potash lye. 
It is employed principally for bronz- 
ing plaster-of-Parls figures, copper, and 
brLs, by mixing it with 6 parts of bone 
ashes robbing ft on wet, or applying it 
with varnish or white of egg in the prep- 
aration of gold paper or for gi ding 
cardboard and wood. Mosaic gold of 
eolden-yellow color is produced by hcat- 
ine 6 parts of sulphur and 16 parts of 
tin amalgam with equal parts of mer- 
cury and 4 parts of sulphur; 8 parts ol 
precipitate from stannic muriate (stannic 
acid) and 4 parts of sulphur also give a 
handsome mosaic gold. 

The handsomest, purest, and most 
gold-like mosaic gold is obtained by 
melting 12 parts of pure tin, free from 
lead, and mixing with C parts of mercury 
to an amalgam. This is mixed with 7 
parts of flowers of sulphur and 6 parts of 
sal ammoniac, whereupon the mass is 
subjected for several hours to a heat 
which at first does not attain redness, 
but eventually when no more fumes are 
generated is increased to dark -red heat. 
This operation is conducted either in a 
glass retort or in an earthenware cru- 
cible. The sal ammoniac escapes first 
on heating, next vermilion sublimates 
and some stannic chloride, while the 
mosaic gold remains on the bottom, the 
upper layer, consisting of lustrous, 
golden, delicately translucent leaflets, 
being the handsomest mosaic gold. 

Genuine Silver Bronze,— This is ob- 
tained by the finely ground waste from 
beating leaf silver or by dissolving silver 
in aqua fortis. This solution is then 
diluted with water and brightly scoured 
copper plates are put in, whereby the 
silver precipitates as a metallic powder. 

Imitation Silver Bronze. — This is ob- 
tained through the waste in beating imi- 
tation leaf silver, which, finely ground, 
is then washed and dried. In order to 
increase the luster it is ground again in a 
dry condition. 

Mosaic Silver. — Mosaic silver is an 
amalgam of equal parts of mercury, bis- 
muth, and tin. One may also melt 50 
parts of good tin in a crucible, and as 
soon as it becomes liquid add 50 parts 
of bismuth, stirring all with an iron wire 
until the bismuth is fused as well. As 
soon as this occurs the crucible must be 
removed from the fire; then stir m, as 
long as the contents arc still liquid, 25 
parts of mercury and mix the whole mass 



evenly until it can be gTound on n c t„

Brushes 

HOW TO TAKE CARE OF PAINT 
AND VARNISH BRUSHES. 

It is a good plan to fill the varnish brush 
before putting it in the keeper. 

Whitewash or kalsomine brushes 
should not be put into newly slaked 
lime or hot kalsomine. 

Cement-set brushes should never be 
put in any alcohol mixture, such as shel- 
lacs and spirit stains. 

Varnish brushes should be selected 
with a view to their possessing the follow- 
ing qualities: 1st, excellence of mate- 
rial; 2d, excellence of make, which 
includes fullness of hair or bristles and 
permanency of binding; 3d, bfe ana 
spring, or elasticity sufficient to enable 
the varnish er to spread the varnish with- 
out reducing it with turpentine; a»| 
4th, springing, when in use, to a tru 
chisel edge. 

Temperature for Brushes. —The bris- 
tles of every brush are held in P^ c f 
the handle. It passes through the siiai 
of the brush and is kiln-dried to 
perfectly. If it shrinks, however, '» 
outward tension is lost and the brisii 
loosened. For this reason tne ^ 
principle in brush care is to , .^ P j n a 
tool, when it is new or not soaKing, 
cool place, out of hot rooms, » n 4jjj|. 
temperature that would tend to 
the wood of the handle.

Cleaning Varnish Brushes.— Varnish 
KrS Snd brushes used in varnish 
f hu^V paint, and all color in yar- 
gh* wS» different handling than 
& brushes. They should be more 
thoroughly dry cleaned, m order that 
bose hairs may be worked out 
After working them through the hand it 
| a good thing to pass the brush back 
and forth over a sheet of sandpaper. 
This rough surface will pull out the loose 
bristles and smooth down the rough 
ends of the chisel point. The brush 
should then be washed by worong it tor 
a few minutes in clean turpentine and 
swinging it dry. It should never be put 
in water. For carriage work and fine 
varnishing the brush should be broken 
in on the rubbing coat in order to work 
out all the dust particles before it is used 
on the finishing coats. 



Setting the Paint -Brush Bristles. — 

For the first 3 or 3 days new brushes 
require special care while at rest. They 
should be dipped in raw oil or the 
paint itself and smoothed out carefully, 
then kid on their sides over night. The 
chisel-pointed brushes should be set at 
an incline, the handle supported just 
enough to allow the brush to lie along 
the point. This is done to prevent twist- 
tog of the bristles, and to keep the shape 
°f the brush. It is necessary to do 
this only a or 3 times before the shape 
becomes set. 

Paint Brushes at Rest, — An impor- 
tant principle in brush care is never to 
•eavc the brush on end while at rest, 
kven f or temporary rest during a job 
brush should never stand on end. 
g* Mght it should always be placed in a 
b fush-keeper"— a water-tight box, or a 
Paint keg, with nails driven through the 
siaes on which the brushes can be sus- 
ffd in water. Holes are bored m 
handles so the brush will hang free 
J? th e bottom, but with the bristles en- 
"rely llt „w water. Before placing 



them in water the brushes should be 
mped so as not to be too full of paint, 
but not cleaned. 1 ' 

Varnish Brushes at Rest—Varnish 
brushes should be kept at rest in tur- 
pentine and varnish, or better, in some 
of the varnish that the brush is used for 
They should preferably not be kept in 
turpentine, as that makes the brush 
" lousy" — roughening the bristles. 

Washing Brushes. — All brushes should 
be washed in benzine or turpentine and 
shaken dry —not whipped — when it is 
desired to change from one color to an- 
other, or from one varnish to another. 

To Restore Brushes. — A good remedj 
to restore lettering brushes which have 
lost their elasticity and do not keep 
point, is as follows: 

Put the pencil in oil and brush it sev- 
eral times over a hot iron in such a mar 
ner that the hairs touch the iron froi 
each side; then dip the pencil quickly ii 
cold water. 

A Removable Binding.— The brist 
bunch of brushes is bound with rope sc 
as to keep them together for use. In- 
stead of the twine, a covering of ruboei 
may be employed, which is easily sbppec 
over the bristles and can be convenient^ 
removed again. The cleaning of tt 
brush is much facilitated thereby, anc 
the breadth of the stripe to be drawi 
with the brush can be accurately regu- 
lated, according to how far the covering 
is slipped over the brush.

BURNS — BU r 



*l?e N flso Ointments and Turpentine. 
Mixture for Burns. — I.— A mixture of 
oil with the white of egg is recom- 
Sded for burns. The eggs are broken 
to a bowl and the castor oil slowly 
poured in while the eggs are beaten. 
Egh oil is added to make a thick 
creamy paste, which is applied to the 
burn- The applications are repeated 
often enough to prevent their becoming 
d r y or sticky. Leave the surface un- 

covered. , 

II —Put 27 parts, by measure, ot 
menthol into 44 parts, by measure, ot 
witch hazel (distillate) and apply freely. 
A good plan is to bandage the parts and 
wet the wrappings with this mixture. 

HI.— A very efficacious remedy tor 
burns is a solution of cooking salt in 
water. It is best to immerse fingers, 
hands, and arms in the solution, which 
must be tolerably strong. For burns in 
the face and other parts of the body, 
salt water poultices are applied. 



Butter 

(See also Foods.) 

Butter Color, — Orlean, SO parts, by 
weight; curcuma root (turmeric), 80 
parts, by weight; olive oil, 240 parts, by 
weight; saffron, 1 part, by weight; alco- 
hol, 5 parts, by weight. The orlean and 
turmeric are macerated with olive oil and 
expressed. The weight of the filtered 
liquid is made up again to 240 parts, by 
weight, with olive oil, next the filtered 
saffron-alcohol extract is added, and the 
alcohol is expelled again by heating the 
mixture. 

Artificial Butter. — I.— Carefully 
washed beef suet furnishes a basis for 
the manufactures of an edible substitute 
for natural butter. The thoroughly 
washed and finely chopped suet is ren- 
dered in a steam-heated tank; 1,000 
parts of fat, 300 parts of water, 1 part of 
potassium carbonate, and 2 stomachs of 
pigs or sheep, are taken. The temper- 
ature of the mixture is raised to 113° ff

H.— Fat from freshly slaughtered cattle 
after thorough washing is placed in clean 
water and surrounded with ice, where it 
is allowed to remain until all animal heat 
has been removed. It is then cut into 
small pieces by machinery and cooked at 
a temperature of about 150° F. (65.(3° C ) 
until the fat in liquid form has separated 
from the tissue, then settled until it i s 
perfectly dear. Then it is drawn into 
the graining vats and allowed to stand 
for a day, when it is ready for the presses. 
The pressing extracts the stearine, leav- 
ing a product commercially known as 
oleo oil which, when churned with cream 
or milk, or both, and with usually a pro- 
portion of creamery butter, the whole 
being properly salted, gives the new food 
product, oleomargarine. 

III. — In making butterine use neutral 
lard, which is made from selected leaf 
lard in a very similar manner to oleo oil, 
excepting that no stearine is extracted. 
This neutral lard is cured in salt brine 
for from 48 to 70 hours at an ice- water 
temperature. It is then taken and, with 
the desired proportion of oleo oil and fine 
butter, is churned with cream and milk, 
producing an article which when proper- 
ly salted and packed is ready for the 
market. In both cases coloring matter 
is used, which is the same as that used Dy 
dairymen to color their butter. At cer- 
tain seasons of the year— viz., in coi 
weather, a small quantity of sesame = on 
or salad oil made from cottonseed loUW

To Impart the Aroma and Taste of 
Natural Butter to Margarine.— In order 
to give margarine the aroma and flavor of 
cow butter, add to it a fatty acid product, 
which is obtained by saponification of 
butter, decomposition of the soap, and 
distillation in the vacuum at about 140° 
F. The addition of the product is made 
upon em ul si fi cation of the fats with milk. 
The margarine will keep for months. 

Harmless Butter Color. — Alum, pul-

spread out and dry over some hot sur- 
face. When dry, again pulverize thor- 
oughly. Protect the product from the 
hgbt. As much of the powder as will 
P on the point of a penknife is added 
to a churnful of milk, or cream, before 
burning, and it gives a beautiful golden 
co or, entirely harmless. To make the 
extract of turmeric add 1 part of pow- 
fered turmeric to 5 parts of alcohol, and

Olive-Oil Paste.— If an ounce of peele. 
garlic be rubbed up into a pulp, in s. 
clean Wedgwood mortar, and to this b 
added from 3 to 4 ounces of good oliv 
oil, with constant rubbing up with the 
pestle, the oil becomes converted into 
pasty mass, like butter. It is possibl 
that the mucilage obtainable from othei 
bulbs of the Litium tribe would prove 
equally efficient in conferring^ semi- 
solidity on the oil, without imparting any 
strong smell. The above composition is 
largely used by the Spanish peasantry 
instead of butter, which runs liquid i 
the Spanish summer. It is known 
"aleoli." The more easily solidifie 
portion of olive oil is stearine, and thi 
may be cheaply prepared from mutto 
fat If added, in certain proportions, t 
olive oil, it would certainly raise its melt

CALAMUS CORDIAL— CAMPHOR 



of Calcium 



CALCIUM CARBIDE: 

CaSTlcaTcium LbfS. is readily at- 
£3Sby the air and the : mondm , con- 
tn?npd in the generators and consequent 
Wdecomposel during the .tonne , -ith 
formation of acetylene gas. Aside from 
the loss, this decomposition is also at- 
tended with dangers. One of the oldest 
Sods of preservation is the "tuition 
of the carbide with petroleum. In using 
such carbide a layer of petroleum forms 
on the surface of the water in the gener- 
ator, which prevents the water from 
evaporating, thus limiting the subse- 
quent generation of acetylene from the 
remaining carbide. Instead of petro- 
leum many other substances have been 
proposed which answer the purpose 
equally well, e. g., toluol, oils, solid bodies, 
which previously have to be liquefied, 
such as stearine, paraffine, rosm, etc. 

Of a different nature is a medium of- 
fered by Letang of Paris._ He em- 

Eloys sugar or saccharine bodies to which 
e adds, if necessary, a little petroleum, 
turpentine, vaseline, or varnish of any 
kind, as well as chalk, limestone, talc, 
sulphur, or sand. The carbide is coated 
with this mixture. The saccharine sub- 
stances dissolve in the generating water, 
and also have a dissolving action on the 
slaked lime, which is formed by the de- 
composition of the carbide which admits 
of its easy removal. 

According to another process carbide 
is put on the market in such a shape 
that, without weighing, merely by count- 
ing or measuring one is in a position to 
use equivalent quantities for every charge. 
Gearing casts molten carbide in the 
shape of bars, and pours a layer of gela- 
tin, glue, and water soluble varnish 
over the carbide bars. Others make 
shells containing a certain quantity of 
reduced carbide. For this ordinary and 
varnished pasteboard, wax paper, tin- 
foil, thin sheet zinc, and similar sub- 
stances may be used which ward off 
atmospheric moisture, thus protecting 
the carbide from premature decompo- 
sition. Before use, the cartridge-like 
shell is pierced or cut open, so that the 
water can get at the contents. The 
more or less reduced carbide is filled in 
the shell, either without any admixture 
or united into a compact mass by a bind- 
ing agent, such as colophony, pitch, tar, 
sand, etc. 

Deodorization of Calcium Carbide.— 
Calcium carbide is known to possess a 



very unpleasant odor because it 
stantly develops small quantities of " 
pure acetylene in contact with th P 
ture of the air. Le Roy, 0 f B*<£ 
proposes for portable— especially W 
cle — lamps, in winch the evil is m 
noticeable than in large plants, simnlvin 
pour some petroleum over the carbid 
and to pour off the remainder not ab- 
sorbed. The petroleum, to which it fa 
well to add some nitro-benzol ( m i r ! 
bane essence), prevents the access of air 
to the carbide, but permits a very satis- 
factory generation of gas on admission of 
water.

CANDLE— CARAMELS 



Candle Coloring.— Candles are colored 
either throughout or they sometimes 
consist of a white b->dy that is covered 
with a colored layer of paraffine wax. 
According to the material from winch 
candles are made (stearine, paraffine, 
or ozokerite), the process of coloring 

varies. . . , , 

Stearine, owing to its acid character, 
dissolves the coal-tar colors much more 
readily than do the perfectly neutral par- 
affine and ozokerite waxes, lor coloring 
stearine the necessary quantity ot the 
color is added to the melted mass and 
well stirred in; if the solution ejected 
happens to be incomplete, a small addi- 
tion of alcohol will prove an effective 
remedy. It is also an advantage to dis- 
solve the colors previously m alcohol and 
add the concentrated solution to the 
melted stearine. The alcohol soon evap- 
orates, and has no injurious effect on 
the quality of the stearine. 

For a number of years there have been 
on the market so-called "fat colors,' 
formed by making concentrated solu- 
tions of the color, and also special prep- 
arations of the colore in stearine. They 
are more easily applied, and are, there- 
fore, preferred to the powdered aniline 
colors, which are apt to cause trouble by 
being accidentally distributed in soluble 
particles, where they are not wanted. 
Since paraffine and ozokerite dissolve 
comparatively little, they will not be- 
come colored, and so must be colored 
indirectly. One way is to dissolve the 
color in oleic acid or in stearine acid and 
add the solution to the wax to be col- 
ored. Turpentine may be employed for 
the same purpose. Concerning the colors 
suitable for candles, there are the cosine 
colors previously mentioned, and also 
chroline yellow, auramine, taniline blue, 
tartrazine, brilliant green, etc. The 
latter, however, bleaches so rapidly that 
it can hardly be recommended. An 
interesting phenomenon is the change 
some colors undergo in a warm tem- 
perature; for instance, some blues turn 
red at a moderate degree of heat (120° 
F.) and return to blue only when com- 
pletely cooled off; this will be noticed 
while the candle mixture is being melted 
previous to molding into candles. 



CANDY KISSES: 
5 pounds of sugar 
3 pounds of glucose 
1 quart of water 
Teaspoonful cream of tartar 
Add a pinch of salt, place in a deep 



pan, boil until a little dropped in cold 
water turns bard. Take off the fire ami 
pour on a table of marble which has been 
previously greased, and with a knife or 
spatula, turn several times or until suf- 
ficiently cool to pull on a hook. "When 
it begins to harden, take down and roll 
into strips about one inch thick and cut 
with scissors to the desired size and wran 
in waxed paper of different colors. Di£ 
ferent flavors can be made by using a 
Little cocoa, grated lemon or orange peel 
chopped, dried fruits, etc. 



CARAMEL : 

Cloudless Caramel Coloring.— L_ 
When it is perfectly understood that in 
the manufacture of caramel, sugar is to 
be deprived of the one molecule oE its 
water of constitution, it will be apparent 
that heat must not be carried on to the 
point of carbonization. Cloudy cara- 
mel is due to the fact that part of the 
sugar has been dissociated and reduced 
to carbon, which is insoluble in water. 
Hence the cloudiness. Caramel may be 
made on a small scale in the following 
manner: Place 4 or 5 ounces of granu- 
lated sugar in a shallow porcelain-lined 
evaporating dish and apply either a 
direct heat or that of an oil bath, con- 
tinuing the heat until caramelization 
takes place or until tumescence ceases 
and the mass has assumed a dark-brown 
color. Then carefully add sufficient 
water to bring the viscid mass to the 
consistence of a heavy syrup. Extreme 
care must be taken and the face and 
hands protected during the addition of 
the water, owing to the intensity ot the 
heat of the mass, and consequent sput- 
tering. 

II.— The ordinary sugar coloring 
material is made from sugar or glucose 
by heating it, while being constantly 
stirred, up to a temperature ot aJOTj 
405° F. A metal pan capable ot noiOMg 
nearly ten times as much as « e .f u |3 
used, is necessary so as to retain j 
mass in its swollen condition. &s > 
as it froths up so as nearly to till the : pg^

must instantly be extinguished or 
moved. The finished product fl

Treatment of Carbolic- Acid Burns. — 
Thoroughly wash the hands with alco- 
hol, and the burning and tingling will 
almost immediately cease. Unless em- 
ployed immediately, however, the alco- 
hol has no effect. When the time 
elapsed since the burning is too great 
for alcohol to be of value, brush the 
burns with a saturated solution of picric 
acid in water. 

Decolonization of Carbolic Acid. — To 
decolorize the acid the following simple 
method is recommended. For purify- 
ing carbolic acid which has already be- 
come quite brown-red on account of 
having been kept in a tin vessel, the re- 
ceptacle is exposed for a short time to 
a temperature of 25° C. (77° F.), thus 
causing only a part of the contents to 
melt. In this state the acid is put into 
glass funnels and left to stand for 10 to 
12 days in a room which is likewise 
kept at the above temperature. Clear 
white crystals form from the drippings, 
which remained unchanged, protected 
from air and light, while by repeating 
the same process more clear crystals are 
obtained from the solidified dark col- 
ored mother lye. In this manner 75 to 
80 per cent of clear product is obtained 
altogether. 

Disguising Odor of Carbolic Acid.— 

Any stronger smelling substance will dis- 
guise the odor of carbolic acid, to an ex- 
tent at least, but it is a difficult odor to 
disguise on account of its persistence. 
Camphor and some of the volatile oils, 
such as peppermint, cajeput, caraway, 
wve, and wmtergreen may be used. 

To Restore Reddened Carbolic Acid. 

UemoTit's method consists in melting 
^ue acid on the water bath, a dding 12 per 
l ; ft nt of alcohol of 95 per cent, letting cool 
J°w* and, after the greater part of the 
m >stance has crystallized out, decanting 



the liquid residue. The crystals ob- 
tained in this manner are snowy white 
and on being melted yield a nearly color! 
less liquid. The alcohol may be recov- 
ered by redistillation at a low tempera- 
ture. Ihis is a rather costly procedure. 

CARBOLIC SOAP:

Preparation of Carbolineum. —I. —Me.. 

together 50 parts of American rosin (F) 
and 150 parts of pale paraffine oil (yel- 
low oil), and add, with stirring, 20 parts 
of rosin oil (rectified). 

II. — Sixty parts, by weight, of black 
coal tar oil of a specific gravity higher 
than 1.10; 25 parts, by weight, of creo- 
sote oil; 25 parts, by weight, of beech- 
wood tar oil of a higher specific weight 
than 0.9. Mix together and heat to 
about 347° F., or until the fumes givei 
off begin to deposit soot. The resulting 
carbolineum is brown, and of somewhat 
thick consistency; when cool it is read 3 
for use and is packed in casks. Thi 
improved carbolineum is applied to wood 
or masonry with a brush; the surfaces 
treated dry quickly, very soon loose th« 
odor of the carbolineum, and are effec 
tively protected from dampness and foi 
mation of fungi.

Casein 

Dried Casein, its Manufacture and 
Uses— For the production of. casein, 
skimmed milk or buttermilk is used, 
articles of slight value, as they cannot be 
employed for feeding hogs or for making 
cheese, except of a very inferior sort, ot 
little or no alimentive qualities. I his 
milk is heated to from 70° to 90° O. 
(175°-195° F-), and sulphuric or hydro- 
chloric acid is added until it no longer 
causes precipitation. The precipitate 
is washed to free it from residual lactose, 
redissolved in a sodium carbonate solu- 
tion, and again precipitated, this time by 
lactic acid. It is again washed, dried, 
and pulverized. It takes 8 gallons of 
skimmed milk to make 1 pound of dry 
casein. 

In the manufacture of fancy, papers, 
or papers that are made to imitate the 
appearance of various cloths, laces, 
and silks, casein is very widely used. 
It is also largely used in waterproof- 
ing tissues, for preparation of water- 
proof products, and various articles 
prepared from agglomeration of cork 
(packing boards, etc.). With lime water 
casein makes a glue that resists heat, 
steam, etc. It also enters into the manu- 
facture of the various articles made from 
artificial ivory (billiard balls, combs, 
toilet boxes, etc.), imitation of celluloid, 
meerschaum, etc., and is finding new 
uses every day. 

Casein (< as known, may act the part 
of an acid and combine with bases to 
form caseinates or caseates; among these 
compounds, caseinates of potash, of 
soda, and of ammonia are the only ones 
soluble in water; all the others are insol- 
uble and may be readily prepared by 
double decomposition, Thus, for ex- 
ample, to obtain caseinate of alumina it 
is sufficient to add to a solution of casein 
in caustic soda, a soluti on of sulphate of 
alumina; an insoluble precipitate of ca- 
sein, or caseinate of alumina, is instantlv 
tormed. 

This precipitate ought to be freed 
trom the sulphate of soda (formed by 
* JL-j Composition), by means of pro- 
Pure, ordinary cellu- 



lose may be incorporated with it hv *v 
process, producing a new compLS* 
cheaper than pure cellulose, althouA 
osscssing the same properties, and ca 



teof replacing it infills appli c TtSS & " 

According to the results desired 
transparency, color, hardness, etc 'th* 
most suitable caseinate should be sele t 
ed. Thus, if a translucent compounds 
to be obtained, the caseinate of alurnin 
yields the best. If a white compound is 
desired, the caseinate of zinc, or of map 
nesia, should be chosen; and for colored 
products the caseinates of iron, copper 
and nickel will give varied tints.' ' 
The process employed for the new prod- 
ucts, with a base of celluloid and casein- 
ate, is as follows: On one hand fascia is 
dissolved in a solution of caustic soda (100 
parts of water for 10 to 25 parts of soda), 
and this liquid is filtered to separate the 
matters not dissolved and the impurities. 
On the other hand, a salt of the base of 
, which the caseinate is desired is dis- 
solved, and the solution filtered. It is 
well not to operate on too concentrated a 
solution. Trie two solutions are mixed 
in a receptacle provided with a mechan- 
ical stirrer, in order to obtain the in- 
soluble caseinate precipitate in as finely 
divided a state as possible. This precip- 
itate should be washed thoroughly, so 
as to free it from the soda salt formed by 
double decomposition, but on account of 
its gummy or pasty state, this washing 
presents certain difficulties, and should 
be done carefully. After the washing 
the mass is freed from the greater part 
of water contained, by draining, followed 
by drying, or energetic pressing; then jt 
is wa shed in alcohol, dried or pressed 
again, and is ready to be incorporated m 
the plastic mass of the celluloid. 

For the latter immersion and washing 
it has been found that an addition ot 1 to

the percentage of caseinate increases; 
finally, the cost price is less than that of 
celluloid, and by using a large proportion 
of caseinate, products may be manu- 
factured at an extremely low cost. 

Phosphate of Casein and its Pro- 
duction.— The process is designed to 
produce a strongly acid compound of 
phosphoric acid and casein, practically 
stable and not hydroscopic, which may 
be employed as an acid ingredient in 
bakers' yeast and for other purposes. 

The phosphoric acid may be obtained 
by any convenient method; for example, 
by decomposing dicalcic or monocaleic 
phosphate with sulphuric acid. The 
commercial phosphoric acid may also be 
employed. 

The casein may be precipitated from 
the skimmed milk" by means of a suitable 
acid, and should be washed with cold 
water to remove impurities. A casein- 
ate may also be employed, such as a 
compound of casein and an alkali or 
a n alkaline earth. 

The new compound is produced in the 
lolloping way: A sufficient quantity of 
phosphoric acid is incorporated with the 
casein or a caseinate in such a way as to 
insure sufficient acidity in the resulting 
^mpound. The employment of 23 to

repeated many times before the desired 
end is reached. A much quicker way is 
to stuff the receptacle full of straw or bad 
hay, laying a stone on top and then filling 
the vessel with water. Although the 
water runs off again, the moistened 
straw remains behind and greatly assists 
the swelling up of the wood.

made out of sand, the same can be after- 
wards washed out. If the casting is to be 
hollow and is to be cast in a metal mold, 
then the process is very simple. Ihe 
mold is filled with molten metal, and 
when the operator thinks the desired 
thickness has cooled next to the walls, he 
pours out the balance. An experienced 
man can make hollow castings in this 
way, and make the walls of any thick- 
ness. 

Casket hardware trimmings, which 
are so extensively used on coffins, es- 
pecially the handles, are nearly all cast 
out of tin and antimony, and in brass 
molds. The metal used is brittle, and 
requires strengthening at the weak por- 
tions, and this is mostly done with wood 
filling or with iron rods, which are 
seemed in the molds before the metal is 
poured in. 

Aluminum castings, which one has 
procured at the foundries, are usually 
alloyed with zinc. This has a close affin- 
ity with aluminum, and alloys readily; 
but this mixture is a detriment and 
causes much trouble afterwards. While 
this alloy assists the molder to produce 
his castings easily, on the other hand it 
will not polish well and will corrode in 
a short time. Those difficulties may be 
avoided if pure aluminum is used 

Plaster of Pads molds are the easiest 
made for pieces where only a few cast- 
ings are wanted. The only difficulty i 3 
that it requires a few days to dry the 
Plaste, thoroughly, and that is aW 
mtely necessary to use them successfully,

To Prevent the Adhesion of 



ModeUns 



Sand to Castings.— Use a mixtnr ^ & 
finely ground coke and - graphite s ff 
though the former material is hinhl'v 
ous, possessing this quality even a N 
fine powder, and the fine pulverizer 3 
is a difficult operation, still the invent! 013 
attains its purpose of producing a « if 
solutely smooth surface. This is 
complished by mixing both substance", 
intimately and adding melted rosin 
whereupon the whole mass is exposed t' 
heat, so that the rosin decomposes in 
carbon residue filling upthe finest pores 
of the coke. The rosin, in melting; 
carries the fine graphite particles along 
into the pores. After cooling the mass 
is first, ground in edge mills, then again in 
a suitable manner and sifted. Sur- 
prising results are obtained with this 
material. It is advisable to take pro- 
portionately little graphite, as the dif- 
ferent co-efficients of expansion of the 
two substances may easily exercise a dis- 
turbing action. One-fifth of graphite,, 
in respect to the whole mass, gives the 
best recults, but it is advisable to add 
plenty of rosin. The liquid mixture 
must, before burning, possess the con- 
sistency of mortar. 

Sand Holes in Cast-Brass Work.- 
Cast-brass work, when it presents nu- 
merous and deep sand holes, should bt 
well dipped into the dipping acid before 
being polished, in order thoroughly to 
clean these objectionable cavities; and 
the polishing should be pushed to an ex- 
tent sufficient to obliterate the smaller 
sand holes, if possible, as this class w 
work looks very unsightly, when platw 
and finished, if pitted all over witu : w 
nute hollows. The larger holes Mgjj 
without considerable labor, be a bMeg 
ated; indeed, it not infrequently happ^ 
that in endeavoring to work , tn eV 
cavities they become enlarged , . * ^ 
often extend deep into the &oay ^ 
metal. An experienced ™n« of 
how far he dare go in polishing w 
this awkward character.

As the geometrically exact contour of 
the coin or medal is often the cause 
§ breaking of the edges, the operator 
sometimes uses wax to make the edges 
appear half round and it also allows the 
casting to be more easily removed from 
the second half of the mold. Kach half 
of the mold should be about the thickness 
.of the finger. The keys, so called, of 
every plaster casting must not be for- 
gotten. In the first casting some little 
half-spherical cavities should be scooped 
out, which will appear in the second half- 
round knobs, and which, by engaging 
vith the depressions, will ensure exact- 
ness in the finished mold. 

After the plaster has set, cut a canal 
for the flow of the molten casting mate- 
rial, then dry the mold thoroughly in 
en oven strongly heated. The halves 
are now ready to be bound together with 
a light wire. When bound heat the 
mold gradually and slowly and let the 
mouth of the canal remain underneath 
while the heating is in progress, in order 
to prevent the possible entry of dirt or 
foreign matter. The heating should be 
continued as long as there is a suspicion

and the feet are connected with an o™l

pieces of fine wire, so that it s perfectly 
free, and thicker wires are run Fr om £ 
sides of the box to the object, which 5 3£ 
sequently serve to form air channel^ 
the mold by their removal. A wooden 
stick, tapering toward the bottom ig 
placed upon the back of the insect to 
produce a runner for casting. The box 
is then filled up with a paste with 3 
parts of plaster of Paris and 1 of brick 
dust, made up with a solution of alum 
and sal ammoniac. It is also well first to 
brush the object with this paste to pre- 
vent the formation of air bubbles. Af- 
ter the mold thus formed has set, the 
object is removed from the interior by 
first reducing it to ashes. It is, there- 
fore, allowed to dry, very slowly at first, 
by leaving in the shade at a normal tem- 
perature (as in India this is much higher 
than in our zone, it will be necessary to 
place the mold in a moderately war 
place), and afterwards heating gradual!; 
to a red heat. This incinerates the ol 
ject, and melts the waxen base upo 
which it is placed. The latter escapes, 
and is burned as it does so, and the ob 
ject, reduced to fine ashes, is remove 
through the wire holes as suggest© 
above. The casting is then made in th 
ordinary manner 

Casting of Soft Metal Castings.— I.— Ij 
is often difficult to form flat back or ha 
castings out of the softer metals so th 
they will run full, owing mostly to V 
thin edges and frail connections. 1 
stead of using solid metal backs for th. 
molds it is better to use cardboard, 
heavy, smooth paper, fastened to 
wooden hoard fitted to the back of t 
other half of the mold. By th m * mean 
very thin castings may be produced that 
would be more difficult with a solid

moiil the drosses should all be saved, 
m n 1 meltf d down when there is enough 

five or ^: times before all the good 
metal is out. 

Fuel.— Where a good soft coal can be 
*fc a ?ow price, as in the middle West, 
m i perhaps the cheapest and easiest 
fuel io Sse; and, besides, it s°me J d - 
Tantaees over gas, which is so much useo. 
JnTJfJt. 1 soft-coal fire can be regu- 
Uted to keep the metal at an eVen tem- 
nerature and it is especially handy to 
Kep Se metal in a molten state during 
the noon hour. This refers particularly 
to the gas furnaces that are operated 
from the power plant in the shop; when 
this power shuts down during the noon 
hour the metal becomes chilled, and 
much time is lost by the remelting after 
one o'clock, or at the beginning in the 
morning. 

Molds. — I. — Brass molds for the cast- 
ing of soft metal ornaments out of bri- 
Unnia, pewter, spelter, etc., should be 
made out of brass that contains enough 
zinc to produce a light-colored brass. 
While this hard brass is more difficult 
for the mold maker to cut, the superior- 
ity over the dark red copper-colored brass 
is that it will stand more heat and 
rougher usage and thereby offset the 
extra labor of cutting the hard brass. 
The mold should be heavy enough to re- 
tain sufficient heat while the worker 
is removing a finished casting from the 
mold so that the next pouring will come 
full. If the mold is too light it cools 
more quickly, and consequently the cast- 
ings are chilled and will not run full. 
Where the molds are heavy enough they 
will admit the use of a swab and water 
after each pouring. This chills the 
casting so that it can be removed easily 
with the plyers. 

II.— Molds for the use of soft metal 
castings may be made out of soft metal. 
This is done with articles that are not 
numerous, or not often used; and may 
be looked upon as temporary. The 
molds are made in part the same as when 
of brass, and out of tin that contains as 
much hardening as possible. The hard- 
ening consists of antimony and copper, 
i-ais metal mold must be painted over 
»eTeral times with Spanish red, which 
tends to prevent the metal from melt-

IV.— A _ good substantial mold * 
small castings of soft metal is m ?A F 
brass. The expense of making the °* 
mold is considerable, however and 38 * 
that account, some manufacturers' ° n 
making their molds by electro-depashi^ 
This produces a much cheaper mo u' 
which can be made very quickly r pv' 
electro-deposited mold, however, is V e 
frail in comparison with a brass'eastin? 
and consequently must be handled verv 
carefully to keep its shape. The elec- 
tro-deposited ones are made out of cotj. 
per, and the backs filled in with a softer 
metal. The handles are secured with 
screws. 

Plaster Molds. — Castings of any metal 
can be done in a plaster mold, provided 
the mold has dried, at a moderate heat, 
for several days. Smoke the mold veil 
with a brand of rosin to insure a full 
cast. Where there are only one or two 
ornaments or figures to cast, it may be 
done in a mold made out of dental plaster. 
After the mold is made and set enoush 
so that it can be taken apart, it should be 

filaced in a warm place and left to dry 
or a day or two. When ready io use 
the inside should be well smoked over 
a gaslight; the mold should be well 
warmed and the metal must not be too 
hot. Very good castings may be ob- 
tained this way; the only objection being 
the length of time needed for a thorough 
drying of the mold. 

Temperature of Metal.— Metals for 
casting purposes should not be over- 
heated. If any of the softer metals show 
blue colors after cooling it is an lnj 
cation that the metal is too hot. xua 
mctal should be healed enough so tJWt 
can be poured, and the finished ca^g

How to Pour Out Castor Oil.— Any one 
ff ho has tried to pour castor oil.: from a 
Tnuare 5-gallon can, when it is full, 
Sows how difficult it is to avoid a mess. 
This however, may be avoided by hav- 
inu a hole punched in the cap which 
sc ?ews onto the can, and a tube, 2 inches 
Ion* and f of an inch in diameter, sol- 
dered on. With a wire nail a hole is 
punched in the top of the can between the 
screw cap and the edge of the can. This 
will admit air while pouring. Resting 
the can on a table, with the screw-cap 
tube to the rear, the can is carefully tilted 
forward with one hand and the shop 
bottle held in the other. In this way the 
bottle may be filled without spilling any 
of the oil and that, too, without a funnel. 
It is preferable to rest the can on a table 
when pouring from a 1- or 2-galIon 
square varnish can, when filling shop 
bottles. _ With the opening to the rear, 
the can is likewise tilted forward slowly 
so as to allow the surface of the liquid to 
become "at rest." Even mobile liquids, 
such as spirits of turpentine, may be 
Poured into shop bottl es without a fun- 
Cel - Of course, the main thing is that 



the can be lowered slowly, otherwise the

How to Take Castor Oil. — The disgust 
for castor oil is due to the odor, not to the 
taste. If the patient grips the nostrils 
firmly before pouring out the dose, 
drinks the oil complacently, and then 
thoroughly cleanses the mouth, lips, 
larynx, etc., with water, removing the 
last vestige of the oil before removing 
the fingers, he will not get the least taste 
from the oil, which is Dland and taste- 
less. It all depends upon preventing any 
oil from entering the nose during the 
time while there is any oil present.

It is a well-known fact that the r 
tions of the compounds of sil Ver f c " 
inum, and chromium in photograSv 
processes are generally voluntar* 
and that the light really acts only a s 
accelerator, that is to say the chenf 1 !

posed to the light under a negative the 
modification of their chemical proner 
ties is accelerated in such 
thru ugh the gradations ^ 
values in the negative, the positive print 
is formed. Now it has been found that 
we also have such accelerators in ma- 
terial substances that can be used in the 
light, the process being termed catalysis. 
It is remarkable that these substances, 
called catalyzers, apparently do not take 
part iu the process, but bring about 
merely by their presence, decomposition 
or combination of other bodies during or 
upon contact. Hence, catalysis may be 
defined, in short, as the act of changing 
or accelerating the speed of a chemical 
reaction by means of agents which ap- 
pear to remain stable. 

Professor Ostwald and Dr. O. Gros, 
of the Leipsic University, have given the 
name of £i! catatvpy" to the new copying 
process. The use of light is entirely 
done away with, except that for the sake 
of convenience the manipulations are 
executed in the light. All that is neces|

New Celluloid. — M. Ortmann has as 
certained that turpentine produced b 1 
the Pinna larix, generally denominate 
Venice turpentine, in combination wit 
acetone (dimethyl ketone), yields the be* 
results; but other turpentines, such a

Formol Albumen for Preparation of 
Celluloid. -Formol has the proper y of 
forming combinations with most albu- 
Kid^bstanccs. Tl f se arc not iden- 
tical with reference to plasticity, and the 
use which may be derived from them for 
the manufacture of plastic substances. 
Sis difference explains why albumen 
should not be confounded with gelatin 
or casein. With this in view, the Societe 
Anonyme I'Oyonnaxienne has originated 
the following processes: 

I —The albumen may be that ot tiie 
ees or that of the blood, which are readily 
found in trade. The formohzing may 
be effected in the moist state or m the 
dry state. The dry or moist albumen 
is brought into contact with the solution 
of commercial formol diluted to 5 or 10 
per cent for an hour. Care must be 
taken to pulverize the albumen, if it is 
dry. The formol penetrates rapidly 
into the albuminoid matter, and is fil- 
tered or decanted and washed with 
water until all the formol in excess has 
completely disappeared; this it is easy to 
ascertain by means of aniline water, 
which produces a turbid white as long 
as a trace of formic aldehyde remains. 

The formol albumen is afterwards 
dried at low temperature by submitting 
it to the action of a current of dry air at 
a temperature not exceeding 107° F. 
Thus obtained, the product appears as 
a transparent corneous substance. On 
pulverizing, it becomes opaque and loses 
its transparency. It is completely in- 
soluble in water, but swells in this 
liquid. 

II. — The formol albumen is reduced 
to a perfectly homogeneous powder, and 
mixed intimately with the plastic matter 
before rolling. This cannot be con- 
sidered an adequate means for effecting 
the mixture It is necessary to introduce 
tne tormol albumen, in the course of the 
moistening, either by making an cmul- 

on with camphor alcohol, or by m£n g 
w.Ji i ■ orou g m y W1 th nitro-cellulose, or by 
Sre of g tJ lm n ltane °^ sl y a "wrouuh mix' 
SixtnL ■ rCe substan ces. When the

■ InStead of adding {he desiccated for- 



mol albumen it may previously v.

more malleable. ren <ler it ! 

Instead of simple water, alkalini 
acidified water may be taken for thi ° r 
pose, or even alcoholized water ^u" 
albumen, then, should be pressed V 
tween paper or cloth, in order to re 
the excess of moisture. m oy e 

Plastic Substances of Nitro-Cellul 
Base —To manufacture plastic substanm 
the Compagme Francaise du CdliS 
commences by submitting casein to 
special operation. It is soaked with I 
solution of acetate of urea in alcohol* 
for 100 parts of casein 5 parts of acetate 
of urea and 50 parts of alcohol are em- 
ployed. The mass swells, and in 48 
hours the casein is thoroughly penetrat- 
ed. It is then ready to be incorporated 
with the camphored nitro-cellulose. The 
nitro-cellulose, having received the addi- 
tion of camphor, is soaked in the alcohol, 
and the mass is well mixed. The casein 
prepared as described is introduced into 
the mass. The whole is mixed and left 
at rest for % days. 

The plastic pulp thus obtained is 
rolled, cut, and dried like ordinary cel- 
lulose, and by the same processes and 
apparatus. The pulp may also be con- 
verted into tubes and other forms, like 
ordinary celluloid. 

It is advisable to subject the improved 
plastic pulp to a treatment with formal- 
dehyde for the purpose of rendering in- 
soluble the casein incorporated in the 
celluloid. The plastic product of nitro- 
cellulose base, thus obtained, presents 
in employment the same general proper- 
ties as ordinary celluloid. It may.M 
applied to the various manufacturing 
processes in use for the preparation « 
articles of all kinds, and its cost price 
diminishes more or less according W «

of celluloid in the mixture may be 50 to 



5 per cent of the weight of the gelatin, 
more or less, according to the result 
desired. After heating the mixture 
slightly, it is worked, cold, by the rollers 
ordinarily employed for celluloid and 
other similar pastes, or by any other suit- 
able metnods. 

The preparation m a closed vessel does 
not differ from that which has been de- 
scribed, except for the introduction of 
the mixture of gelatin, celluloid, alco- 
hol, and acetone, at the moment when 
the heating is to he accomplished in an 
autoclave heated with steam, capable of 
supporting a pressure of 2 to 5 pounds, 
and furnished with a mechanical agita- 
tor. This method of proceeding abridges 
the operation considerably ; the paste 
comes from the autoclave well min- 
gled, and is then submitted to the 
action of rollers. There is but little 
work in distilling the alcohol and acetic 
a «d hi the autoclave. These may be 
recovered, and on account of their evap- 
oration the mass presents the desired 
^asistency when it reaches the rollers.

loid to be treated while it is still in the

glass, porcelain, or similar material. 

The mass containing the fish glue is 
poured in, drop by drop, while stirring 
carefully, taking care to pour it in the 
middle of the celluloid and to increase 
the surface of contact. 

When the mixture is complete, the cel- 
luloid is ready to be employed and does 
not produce flame when exposed. 

The solution of fish glue may be pre- 
pared by allowing 200 parts of it to swell 
for 48 hours in 1,000 parts of cold dis- 
tilled water. It is then passed through 
the sieve, and the pieces which may re- 
main are broken up, in order to mingle 
them thoroughly with the water. Ten 
parts of kitchen salt are then added, and 
the whole mass passed through the 



sieve.
