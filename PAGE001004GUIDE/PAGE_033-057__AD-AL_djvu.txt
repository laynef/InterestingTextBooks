soliaiues, for gas and wood distillation 
retorts, etc., and similar places where 
quickness of setting is requisite. It is 
more often, however, used with some 
fibrous material to give it greater strength. 
Asbestos is the most commonly used 
material of these, as it will stand a high 
temperature. When that is not so im- 
portant, straw, plush trimmings, hair, 
etc., are used as binders, while broken 
stone, glass, and various mineral sub- 
stances are used as fillers, but they do 
not add anything to the strength. 
These lutes seem to be particularly suit- 
able for oil vapors and hydrocarbon 
gases. 

Formulas: 

(1) Plaster and water. 

(2) Plaster (wet) and asbestos. 

(3) Plaster (wet) and straw. 

(4) Plaster (wet) and plush trim- 

mings. 

(5) Plaster (wet) and hair. 

(6) Plaster (wet) and broken stone, 

etc. 

II. Hydraulic Cement. — ■ Cement is 
used either alone or with sand, asbestos, 
etc. These lutes are suitable for nitric 
acid. When used with substances such 
as rosin or sulphur, cement is probably 
employed because it is in such a fine 
state of division and used as a filler and 
not because of any powers of setting by 
hydration. 

Formulas: 

(1) Cement — neat. 

(2) Cement and asbestos. 

(3) Cement and sand. 

III. Clay. — This most frequently en- 
ters into the composition of lutes as a 
filler, but even then the very finely divid- 
ed condition of certain grades renders 
it valuable, as it gives body to a liquid, 
such as linseed oil, which, unless stiff- 
ened, would be pervious to a gas, trfe 
clay In all cases being neutral. Thus, 
for luting pipes carrying chlorine, a stiff 
paste of clay and molasses has been sug- 
gested by Thco. ICbller in Die Surrogate, 
but it soon gives way. 

Formulas: 

(1) Clay and linseed oil. 

(2) Same, using fire clay. 

(3) Clay and molasses. 

(1) Is suitable for steam, etc.; (£) for 
chlorine, and (3) for oil vapors. 

IV. Lime is used in the old lute known 
as P^tty, which consists of caustic lime 
a-nd Unseed oil. Frequently the lime is 
replaced by chalk and china clay, but 
t[ie nme should be, in part at least, caus- 
ae, so as to form a certain amount of 
1CDe soap. Lime is also used in silicate 



and casein compositions, which are verv

Formulas' 

(1) Lime and boiled oil to stiff mass. 

(2) Clay, etc., boded oil to stiff 

mass. 

V. Asphalt and Pitch. -These sub- 
stances are used m lutes somewhat inter- 
changeably. As a rule, pitch makes the 
stronger lutes. Tar is sometimes used 
but, because of the light oils and fre- 
quently, water contained, it is not so 
good as either of the others. 

Asphalt dissolved in benzol is very 
useful for uniting glass for photographic 
microscopical, and other uses. Also" 
for coating wood, concrete, etc., where 
the melted asphalt would be too thick 
to cover well. Benzol is the cheapest 
solvent that is satisfactory for this pur- 
pose, as the only one that is cheaper 
would be a. petroleum naphtha, which 
does not dissolve all the constituents of 
the asphalt. For waterproofing wood, 
brick, concrete, etc., melted asphalt 
alone is much used, but when a little 
paraffine is added, it improves its water- 
proofing qualities, and in particular cases 
boiled oil is also added to advantage. 

Formulas: 

1. Refined lake asphalt. 

2. Asphalt 4 parts 

Paraffine 1 part 

3. Asphalt 10 parts 

Paraffine 2 parts 

Boiled oil 1 part 

Any of these may be thinned with hot 
benzol or toluol. Toluol is less volatile 
than benzol and about as cheap, if not 
cheaper, the straw-colored grades being 
about 24 cents per gallon.

These compositions are used to unit* 
slate slabs and stoneware for domestic, 
engineering, and chemical purposes. Va 
rious rosin and pitch mixtures are used 
for these purposes, and the proportions 
of these two ingredients arc determined 
by the consistency desired. Sulphurand 
stone powder are added to prevent the 
formation of cracks, sulphur acting chem- 
ically and stone powder mechanically. 



Where the lute would come m contact 
Ith acid or vapors of the same, lime- 
stone should not be the powder used, 
otherwise it is about the best. Wax is a 
useful ingredient to keep the composi- 
tion from getting brittle with age. 

A class of lutes under this general 
grouping that are much used are so- 
falleS '^marine glu.es"> v.). They 
must be tough and elastic. When used 
for calking on a vessel they must expand 
and contract with the temperature and 
not crack or come loose.

Fastening Cork to Metal.— I n iasten , 
ing cork to iron and brass, even when 
these are lacquered, a good sealing wax 
containing shellac will be found to serve 
the purpose nicely. Wax prepared with 
rosin is not suitable. The cork surface 
is painted with the melted sealing was. 
The surface of the metal is heated with 
a spirit flame entirely free from soot, 
until the sealing wax melts when pressed 
upon the metallic surface. The wax : 
held in the flame until it burns, and it 
then applied to the hot surface of the 
metal. The cork surface painted wit! 
sealing wax is now held in the flame, anc 
as soon as the wax begins to melt the 
cork is pressed firmly on the metallic sur- 
face bearing the wax,

_ Albumen Paste.— Fresh egg albumen 
is recommended as a paste for affixing 
labels on bottles. It is said that labels 
put on with this substance, and well 
dried at the time, will not loosen even 
when bottles are put into water and left 
there for some time. Albumen, dry, is 
almost proof against mold or ferments. 
as to cost, it is but little if any higher

being sufficient to attach at least 100 
medium-sized labels.

Agar Agar Paste.— The agar agar is 
broken up small, wetted with water, and 
exposed in an earthenware vessel to the ac- 
tion of ozone pumped under pressure into 
the vessel f rom the ozonizing apparatus. 
About an hour of this bleaches the agar 
agar and makes it freely soluble in boil- 
ing water, w r hen solutions far more con- 
centrated than has hitherto been possible 
can be prepared. On cooling, the solu- 
tions assume a milky appearance, but 
form no lumps and are readily relique- 
fied by heating. If the solution is com- 
pletely evaporated, as of course happens 
when the adhesive is allowed to dry after 
use, it leaves a firmly holding mass which 
is insoluble in cold water. Among the 
uses to which the preparation can be 
applied are the dressing of textile fabrics 
and paper sizing, and the production of 
photographic papers, as well as the or- 
dinary uses of an adhesive.

parts boiled starch are previously stirred 
together with 20 parts cold water, s« 
that a thin, milky liquid without lump* 
results. The boiling glue solution ia 
poured into this while stirring constantly, 
and the whole is kept boiling another 10 
minutes.

III.— A fair knotting varnish free 
from surplus oil is by far the best adhe- 
sive for fixing labels, especially on metal 
surfaces. It dries instantly, insuring 
* speedy job and immediate packing, if 
needful, without fear of derangement. 
It has great tenacity, and is not only 
absolutely damp-proof itself, but is actu- 
ally repellent of moisture, to which all 
water pastes are subject. It costs more, 
but the additional expense is often infini- 
tesimal compared with the pleasure of a 
satisfactory result.

Preservatives for Paste. — Various a 
tiseptics are employed for the preserv 
tion of flour paste, mucilage, etc. Bo 
and salicylic acids, oil of cloves, oil 
sassafras, and solution of formaldehy 
arc among those which have given be 
service. A durable starch paste is pr 
duced by adding some borax to t" 
water used in making it. A paste fro 
10 parts (weight) starch to 100 pa 
(weight) water with 1 per cent bor 
added will keep many weeks, while wi 
out this addition it will sour after 
days. In the case of a gluing mateii 
prepared from starch paste and joiner 
glue, borax has also demonstrated its pi 
serving qualities. The solution is ma 
by mixing 10 parts (weight) starch in 
a paste with water and adding 10 pa 
(weight) glue soaked in water to the 
solution; the addition of -,V part (weigh 
of borax to the solution will cause it 
keep for weeks. It is equal to theb 
glue, but should be warmed and stirr 
before use. 

Board-Sizing.— A cheap sizing

until it thickens. This paste is 1 - 
white and becomes transparent °' se

and the precipitate is dried without arti- 
ficial heat. The resulting calcium tan- 
nate is then mixed, according to the pur- 
pose for which the adhesive is intended, 
with from 1 to 10 times its weight of dry 
casein by grinding in a mill. The ad- 
hesive compound is soluble in water, 

fietroleum, oils, and carbon bisulphide, 
t is very strong, and is applied in the 
form of a paste with water. 

PASTES FOR PAPERH AUGERS. 

J,— Use a cheap grade of rye or wheat 
flour, mix thoroughly with cold water to 
about the consistency of dough, or a little 
thinner, being careful to remove all 
lumps; stir in a tablespoonful of pow- 
dered alum to a quart of flour, then pour 
in boiling water, stirring rapidly until the 
flour is thoroughly cooked. Let this cool 
before using, and thin with cold water. 

II. — Venetian Paste. — 

(a) 4 ounces white or fish glue 
8 fluidounces cold water 

(b) 2 fluidounces Venice turpentine 

(c) 1 pound rye flour 

16 fluidounces (1 pint) cold water 

(d) 64 fluidounces (| gallon) boiling 

water 

Soak the 4 ounces of glue in the cold 
water for 4 hours; dissolve on a water 
bath (glue pot), and while hot stir in the 
Venice turpentine. Make up (e) into a 
batter free from lumps and pour into (d). 
Stir briskly, and finally add the glue so- 
lution. This makes a very strong paste, 
and it will adhere to a painted surface, 
owing to the Venice turpentine in its 
composition. 

III. — Strong Adhesive Paste 

(a) 4 pounds rye flour 

3 gallon cold water 

(b) l| gallons boiling water 

(c) 2 ounces pulverized rosin 

Make (a) into a bai ter free from lumps; 
then pour into (h). Boil if necessary, and 
Trhile hot stir in the pulverized rosin a 
little at a time. This paste is exceed- 
ingly strong, and will stick heavy wall 
paper or thin leather. If the paste be 
too thick, thin with a little hot water; 
never thin paste with cold water. 

IV. — Flour Paste 

(a) 2 pounds wheat flour 
, 32 fluidounces (1 quart) cold water 
(o) 1 ounce alum 

4 fluidounces hot water 
(0 96 fluidounces gallon) boiling 
water 

Work the wheat flour into a batter free 
Irc-m lumps with the cold water. Dis- 
solve the alum as designated in (6). 



Now stir in (a) and (c) and, if necessarv

V. — Elastic or Pliable Paste 

(a) 4 ounces common starch 
3 ounces white dextrine 

10 fluidounces cold water 

(b) 1 ounce borax 
3 fluidounces glycerine

translucent. This paste will not crack 
and, being very pliable, is used for pape 
cloth, leather, and other material wher 
flexibility is required. 

VI. — A paste with which wall pape 
can be attached to wood or masonr 
adhering to it firmly in spite of dam 
ness, is prepared, as usual, of rye flour, 
which, however, are added, after the bo"

oil varnish and 8£ parts, by weight, 
turpentine to every 500 parts, by weigh 

VII— Paste for Wall Paper.— Soak 1 
pounds of bolus (bole) in water, after 
has been beaten into small fragment 
and pour off the supernatant wate 
Boil 10 ounces of glue into glue wate 
mix it well with the softened bolus an 
2 pounds plaster of Paris and strai 
through a sieve by means of a brus 
Thin the mass with water to the consis 
ency of a thin paste. The paste is no 
ready for use. It is not only inuc 
cheaper than other varieties, but has th 
advantage over them of adhering bette 
to whitewashed walls, and especially 
such as have been repeatedly coated ove 
the old coatings which were not thor 
oughly removed. For hanging fine wa 
paper this paste is less commendabJ; 
as it forms a white color, with whic 
the paper might easily become soiled 
great care is not exercised in applyin 
it. If the fine wall paper is mounted o 
ground paper, however, it can he recom 
mended for pasting the ground paper o 
the wall.

I. — Tragacanth I 

Acacia * 

Thymol 

Glycerine 

Water, sufficient to

Dissolve the gums in 1 pint of water, 
strain, and add the glycerine, in which 
the thymol is suspended; shake well and 
add sufficient water to make 2 pints. 
This separates on standing, but a single 
shake mixes it sufficiently for use. 

II.— Rye flour 8 ounces 

Powdered acacia 1 ounce 

Glycerine 2 ounces 

Oil of cloves 40 drops 

Rub the rye flour and acacia to a 
smooth paste with 8 ounces of cold water; 
strain through cheese cloth, and pour 
into 1 pint of boiling water, and continue 
the heat until as thick as desired. When 
nearly cold add the glycerine and oil of 
cloves. 

III. — Rye flour 5 parts 

Venice turpentine ... 1 part 
Liquid glue, a sufficient quantity 
Rub up the flour with the turpentine 
and then add sufficient freshly prepared 
glue (glue or gelatine dissolved in water) 
to make a stiff paste. This paste dries 
slowly.

This mixture furnishes a gluing ager* 
which, it is claimed, even renders tl 
labels proof against being loosened 1 
moisture. 

IX. - Pour 140 parts of distilled G0 V 
water over 100 parts of gum arabic in 
wide-necked bottle and dissolve by f re . 
quent shaking. To the solution, whiefc 
is ready after standing for about 3 days 
add 10 parts of glycerine; later, 20 parts, 
diluted acetic acid, and finally Q parts 
aluminum sulphate, then straining 
through a fine-hair sieve. 

X. — Good glue is said to be obtaine 
by dissolving 1 part of powdered suga 
in 4 parts of soda water glass. 

XI. — A glue for bottle labels is pre 
pared by dissolving borax in water 
soak glue in this solution and dissoh 
the glue by boiling. Carefully drop 
much acetic acid into the solution 
will allow it to remain thin on cooling 
Labels affixed with this agcnt < adhere 
firmly and do not become moldy in damp 
cellars. 

XII. — Dissolve some isinglass in acetic 
acid and brush the labels over with it. 
There will be no cause to complain 
of their coming off, nor of striking 
through the paper. Take a wide- 
mouthed bottle, fill about two-thirds with 
commercial acetic acid, and put in as much 
isinglass as the liquid will hold, and set 
aside in a warm place until completely 
dissolved. When cold it should form a 
jelly. To use it place the bottle in hot 
water. The cork should be well-fit- 
ting and smeared with vaseline or melted 
paraffine. 

How to Paste Labels on Tin.— Brush 
over the entire back of the label Y llt V* 
flour paste, fold the label loosely by 
sticking both ends together without 
creasing the center, and throw to one 
side until this process has been gone 
through with the whole lot. Then unto m

regular manner. The paste o«g^L n "

naste upon the labels in the first place, 
follow the method of placing the dry 
labels over one another, back sides up, 
with the edge of each just protruding over 
the edge oi the one beneath it, so that 
the fingers may easily grasp the label 
after the pasting has been done. 

Druggists' Label Paste. — This paste, 
when carefully made, is an admirable one 
for label use, and a very little will go a 
long way: 

Wheat flour '. . 4 ounces 

Nitric acid 1 drachm 

Boric acid 10 grains 

Oil of cicves 5 drops 

Carbolic void £ drachm 

Stir flour and water together, mixing 
thoroughly, and add the other ingre- 
dients. After the stuff is well mixed, 
beat it, watching very carefully and re- 
moving the instant it stiffens. 

To Attach Glass Labels to Bottles. — 
Melt together 1 part of rosin and 2 parts 
of yellow wax, and use while warm. 

Photographic Motmtants (see also 
Photography). — Owing to the nature of 
the different papers used for printing 
photographs, it is a matter of extreme 
importance to use a mountant that shall 
not set up decomposition in the coating 
of the print. For example, a mountant 
that exhibits acidity or alkalinity is in- 
jurious with most varieties of paper; and 
in photography the following formulas 
for pastes, mucilages, etc., have there- 
fore been selected with regard to their 
absolute immunity from setting up de- 
composition in the print or changing its 
tone in any way. One of the usual 
mountants is rice starch or else rice water. 
The latter is boiled to a thick jelly, 
strained, and the strained mass used 
as an agglutinant for attaching photo- 
graphic prints to the mounts. There is 
nothing of an injurious nature whatever 
in this mountant, neither is there in a 
mucilage made with gum dragon. 

This gum (also called gum traga- 
canth) is usually in the form of curls 
0-e., leaf gum), which take a long time 
to properly dissolve in water — several 
weeks in fact— but during the past few 
years there has been put on the market a 
Powdered gum dragon which does not 
occupy so many days in dissolving. To 
make a mucilage rom gum dragon a 
very large volume of water is required. 
*or example, 1 ounce of the gum, either 
le af or powder, will swell up and con- 
Vert l gallon of water into a thiekish 
mucilage in the course of 2 or 3 weeks. 



Only cold water must be used, and b 
ore using the mucilage, all whitis 
lumps (which are particles of undissolve 
gum) should be picked out or else Tf 
mucilage strained. The time of sclutid 
can be considerably shortened (to a fe 
hours) by acidifying the water in whic 
the gum is placed with a little sulphuri 
or oxalic acid; but as the resultant muci 
lage would contain traces of their pre 
ence, such acids are not permissibl 
when the gum-dragon mucilage is to b 
used for mounting photographs. 

Glycerine and gum arabic make a ve 
good adhesive of a fluid nature suite 
to mounting photographs; and althoug 
glycerine is hygroscopic by itself, su 
tendency to absorb moisture is ehecke 
by the reverse nature of the gum arabi 
consequently an ideal fluid mucilage 
produced. _ The proportions of the se 
era! ingredients are these: 

Gum arabic, genuine 
(gum acacia, not 

Bassora gum) 4 ounces 

Boiling water 12 ounces 

Glycerine, pure 1 ounce 

First dissolve the gum in the wate 
and then stir in the glycerine, and all 
all debris from the gum to deposit befo 
using. The following adhesive co 
pound is also one that is free from che 
ical reactions, and is suited for phot 
graphic purposes: 

Water 2 pints 

Gum dragon, pow- 
dered 1 ounce 

Gum arabic, genuine 4 ounees 

Glycerine 4 ounces 

Mix the gum arable with half the w 
ter, and in the remainder of the wat 
dissolve the gum dragon. When bo 
solids are dissolved, mix them togethe 
and then stir in the glycerine. 

The following paste will be found 
useful mountant:

suitable mountants 

PrJnt Aleohol, absolute. ... 10 ounces 

Gelatine, good 1 ounce 

Glycerine i to 1 ounce 

Soak the gelatine in water for an hour 
or two until it is completely softened; 
take the gelatine out of the water, and 
allow it to drain, and put it into ft 
bottle and pour alcohol over it; add the 
glycerine (if the gelatine is soft use 
only £ ounce; if the gelatine is hard, use 
1 ounce of the glycerine), then melt the 
gelatine by standing the bottle in a vessel 
of hot water, and shake up very well. 
For use, remelt by heat. The alcohol 
prevents the prints from stretching or 
cockling, as they are apt to, under the 
influence of the gelatine. 

In the following compound, however, 
only sufficient alcohol is used to serve as 
an antiseptic, and prevent the aggluti- 
nant from decomposing : Dissolve 4 
ounces of photographic gelatine in 16 
ounces of water (first soaking the gela- 
tine therein for an hour or two until it is 
completely softened), then remove the 
gelatine from the water, allow it to drain, 
and put it into the bottle, and pour the 
alcohol over it, and put in the glycerine 
(if the gelatine is soft, use only I ounce; 
if the gelatine is hard, use 1 ounce of the 
glycerine), then melt the gelatine by 
standing the bottle in a vessel of hot 
water, and shake up well and mix thor- 
oughly. For use, remelt by heat. The 
alcohol prevents the print from stretch- 
ing or cockling up under the influence of 
the gelatine. 

The following paste agglutinant is one 
that is very permanent and useful for all 
purposes required in a photographic 
studio: Take 5 pints of water, 10 ounces 
ot arrowroot, 1 ounce of gelatine, and a 
t pint (10 fluidounces) of alcohol, and 
proceed to combine them as follows: 
Make arrowroot into a thick cream with 
a little of the water, and in the remainder 
Pi the water soak the gelatine for a few 
afte , r w J lic} } m elt the gelatine in 
root nA? by 5 e ^ n S h < add the a "ow- 
boil and allow to boil for 4 or 5 minutes, 



then allow to cool, and mix in the alcoti i 
adding a few drops of oil of cloves. 1 

Perhaps one of the most useful co 
pounds tor photographic purposes is tW 
prepared as follows: Soak 4 ounces of 
hard gelatine in 15 ounces of water f or 
few hours, then melt the gelatine hv 
heating it in a glue pot until the solution 
is quite clear and free from lumps. Add 
6 oz. of starch to 65 oz. of cold water 
stir until free from lumps. Pour this into 
the boiling; gelatine solution, and con- 
tinue stirring, and if the starch is not 
completely cooked, boil up the mixture 
for a few minutes until it "blows," being 
careful to keep it well stirred so ad not 
to burn; when cold add a few drops of 
carbolic acid or some essential oil as an 
antiseptic to prevent the compound from 
decomposing or becoming sour. 

A useful photographic mucilage, which 
is very liquid, is obtained by mixing equal 
bulks of gum-arabic and gum-dragon 
mucilages of the sameconsistence. The 
mixture of these mucilages will be con- 
siderably thinner than either of them 
when alone. 

As an agglutinant for general use in the 
studio, the following is recommended: 
Dissolve 2 ounces of gum arabic in 5 
ounces of water, and for every 250 parts 
of the mucilage add 20 parts o£ a. solu- 
tion of sulphate of aluminum, prepared 
by dissolving 1 part of the sulphate in 
20 parts of water (common alum should 
not be used, only the pure aluminum 
sulphate, because common alum is a 
mixture of sulphates, and usually con- 
taminated with iron salts). The addi- 
tion of the sulphate solution to the 
gum mucilage renders the latter less 
hygroscopic, and practically waterproof, 
besides being very adhesive to _ any 
materials, particularly those exhibiting a 
smooth surface. 

MUCILAGES : 

For Affixing Labels to Glass and Other 
Objects. — I. — The mucilage is made dv 
simply pouring over the gum e .^ oU ^i 
water to a little more than cover it, &Q 
then, as the gum swells, adding p ore ^i 
from time to time in small portions un^

III. — Rye flour Bounces 

Powdered acacia. 1 ounce 

Glycerine 2 ounces 

Oil of cloves 40 drops

Rub the rye flour and the acacia to a

strain through cheese cloth, and pour 
into 1 pi 11 * °f boiling water and continue 
the heat until as thick as desired. When 
nearly cold add the glycerine and oil of 
cloves. 

IV. — One part, by weight, of traga- 
canth, when mixed with 95-per-cent alco- 
hol to form 4 fluidounces, forms a liquid in 
which a portion of the tragacanth is dis- 
solved and the remainder suspended; 
this remains permanently fluid, never 
deteriorates, and can be used in place of 
the present mucilage; 4 to 8 minims to 
each ounce of mixture is sufficient to 
suspend any of the insoluble substances 
usually given in mixtures. 

V. — To 250 parts of gum-arabic muci- 
lage add 20 parts of water and 2 parts of 
sulphate of alumina and heat until dis- 
solved. 

VI. — Dissolve § pound gum traga- 
canth, powdered, \ pound gum arable, 
powdered, cold water to the desired con- 
sistency, and add 40 drops carbolic acid. 

Mucilage of Acacia.— Put the gum, 
which should be of the best kind, in a flask 
the size of which should be large enough 
to contain the mucilage with about one- 
fifth of its space to spare (i. e., the product 
should fill it about four fifths full). Now 
tare, and wash the gum with distilled wa- 
ter, letting the latter drain away as much 
as possible before proceeding further. 
Add the requisite quantity of distilled 
water slowly, which, however, should 
in-st have added to it about ] 0 per cent of 
hmewater. Now cork the flask, and lay 
H without shaking, horizontally in a cool 
Place and let it remain quietly for about 
I hours, then give it a half turn to the 
right _ without disturbing its horizontal 
position. Repeat this operation three or 
lour times during the day, and keep it 
until the gum is completely dissolved 
(.'which will not be until the fourth day 
iP. r °hably), then strain through a thin 
| cloth previously wet with distilled wa- 
I "; r » avoiding, in so doing, the formation 
j °i foam or bubbles. This precaution 
Should, also be observed in deeantation 



of the percolate into smaller bottles m-o 
vided with paraffine corks. The small 
amount of hmewater, as will be u rider 
stood, is added to the solvent water in 
order to prevent the action of free acid! 

Commercial Mucilage. — Dissolve * 
pound white glue m equal parts water 
and strong vinegar, and add \ as much 
alcohol and £ ounce alum dissolved in a 
little water. To proceed, first get good 
glue and soak in cold water until it 
swells and softens. Use pale vinegar, 
lour off the cold water, then melt the 

8 j\ e i° a tlliok paste in not water, and 
add the vinegar hot. When a little cool 
add the alcohol and alum water. 

To Render Gum Arabic More Ad- 
hesive. — I. — Add crystallized aluminum 
sulphate in the proportion of 2 dissolved 
in 20 parts of water to 250 parts of con- 
centrated gum solution (75 parts of gum 
in 175 parts of water). 

H- — Add to 250 parts of concentrated 
gum solution (2 parts of gum in 5 parts 
of water) 2 parts of crystallized alumi- 
num sulphate dissolved in 20 parts of 
water. This mixture glues even unsized 
paper, pasteboard on pasteboard, wood 
on wood, glass, porcelain, and other 
substances on which labels frequently do 
not adhere well. 

Envelope Gum. — The gum used by 
the United States Government on postage 
stamps is probably one of the best that 
could be used not only for envelopes but 
for labels as well. It will stick to almost 
any surface. Its composition is said to 
be the following: 

Gumarabic 1 part 

Starch 1 part 

Sugar 4 parts 

Water, sufficient to 
give the desired con- 
sistency. 

The gum arabic is first dissolved in 
some water, the sugar added, then the 
starch, after which the mixture is boi ed 
for a few minutes in order to dissolve 
the starch, after which it is thinned down 
to the desired consistency. 

Cheaper envelope gums can be made 
by substituting dextrine for the gum 
arabic, glucose for the sugar, and [adding 
boric acid to preserve and help stiffen it

The following is a simple and accurate 
method for the determination of albumen 
in urine: 

In a test tube filter 5 cubic centimeters 
of urine which should be clear. If the 
urine is turbid, it indicates the presence 
of protein or phosphate. Heat till it 
boils gently at the surface and add 
gradually to it 3-5 drops of 10 per cent 
acetic acid. If the precipitate disappears 
phosphates are present whereas if the 
precipitate remains and becomes more 
floccnlent albumen is present.

Alcohol, Tests for Absolute. — The 

committee for the compilation of the 
German Arzneibuch established the fol- 
lowing tests for the determination of ab- 
solute alcohol: 

Absolute alcohol is a clear, colorless, vol- 
atile, readily imflammable liquid which 
burns with a faintly luminous flame. 
Absolute alcohol has a peculiar odor, a 
burning taste, and does not affect litmus 
paper. Boiling point, 78.50. Specific 
gravity, 0-795 to 0.707. One hundred 
parts contain 99.7 to 99.4 parts, by vol- 
ume, or 99.6 to 99.0 parts, by weight, of 
alcohol. 

Absolute alcohol should have no for- 
eign smell and should mix with water 
Without cloudiness. 

After the admixture of 5 drops of sil- 
ver-nitrate solution, 10 cubic centimeters 
of absolute alcohol should not become 
turbid or colored even on heating. 

A mixture of 10 cubic centimeters of 
absolute alcohol and 0.2 cubic centimeter 
of potash lye evaporated down to 1 cubic 
centimeter should not exhibit an odor of 
fusel oil after supersaturation with dilute 
sulphuric acid. 

Five cubic centimeters of sulphuric 
acid, carefully covered, in a test tube, 
with a stratum of 5 cubic centimeters of 
absolute alcohol, should not form a rose- 
colored zone at the surface of contact, 
even on standing for some time. 

The red color of a mixture of 10 cubic 
centimeters of absolute alcohol and 1 
cubic centimeter of potassium -perman- 
ganate solution should not pass into 
yellow before 20 minutes. 

Absolute alcohol should not be dyed 
by hydrogen sulphide water or by aque- 
ous ammonia. 

Five cubic centimeters of absolute al- 
cohol should not leave behind a weighable 
residue after evaporation on water bath. 

Absolute Alcohol.— If gelatine be sus- 
pended in ordinary alcohol it will absorb 
the water, but as it is insoluble in alcohol, 
that substance will remain behind, and 
thus nearly absolute alcohol will be ob- 
tained without distillation.

green. It appears in the market, in tl 
form of small cubes. 

Alcohol in Fermented Beers. — Expe* 
rience has shown that \ pound of suga 
to 1 gallon of water yields about 2 per cei 
of proof spirit, or about 1 per cent of al 
solute alcohol. Beyond this amount it i 
not safe to go, if the legal limit is to t 
observed, yet a ginger beer brewed witl 
\ pound per gallon of sugar would be 
very wishy-washy compound, and thei 
is little doubt that a much larger quantit 
is generally used. The more sugar tha 
is used — up to 1 J or 1 J pounds per galloi 
— the better the drink will be and th 
more customers will relish it; but it wi. 
be as "strong" as lager and contain per 
baps 5 per cent of alcohol, which will make 
it anything but a "temperance" drink. 
Any maker who is using as much as even 
\ pound of sugar per gallon is bound tc 
get more spirit than the law allows 
Meanwhile it is scarcely accurate to ten 
ginger beers, etc., non-alcoholic.

these are highly "hopped" or "bittp i »

trary, are less accentuated by lengthen °j 
fermentation, and abound in saccha 
and gummy matter. They are 
fore, more nutritious, though less into 
icating, than those previously referred ?~ 

In brewing the finer kinds of ales na?" 
malt and the best hops of the current 
season's growth are always employed* 
and when it is desired to produce a hquor 
possessing little color, very great atten- 
tion is paid to their selection. With the 
same object, the boiling is conductedwith 
more than the usual precautions, and the 
fermentation is carried on at a somewhat 
lower temperature than that commonly 
allowed for other varieties of beer. For 
ordinary ale, intended for immediate use, 
the malt may be all pale; but, if the liquor 
be brewed for keeping, and in warm 
weather, when a slight color is not objec- 
tionable, one-fifth, or even one-fourth of 
amber malt may be advantageously em- 
ployed. From 41 to 6 pounds of hops is 
the quantity commonly used to the one- 
fourth of malt, for ordinary ales; and 7 
pounds to 10 pounds for "keeping" ales. 
The proportions, however, must greatly 
depend on the intended quality and de- 
scription of the brewing and the period 
that will be allowed for its maturation. 

The stronger varieties of ale usually 
contain from 6 to 8 per cent of "absolute 
alcohol"; ordinary strong ale, 41 to 6 per 
cent; mild ale, 3 to 4 percent; and table ale, 
1 to li per cent (each by volume); togeth- 
er with some undecomposed saccharine, 
gummy, and extractive matter, the bitter 
and narcotic principles of the hop, some 
acetic acid formed by the oxidation oi 
the alcohol, and very small and variable 
quantities of mineral and saline matter.

Alloys 

No general rules can be given for 
alloying metals. Alloys differing greatly 
in fusibility are commonly made by 
adding the more fusible ones, either in 
the melted state or in small portions at a 
time, to the other melted or heated to 
the lowest possible temperature at which 
perfect union will take place between 
them. The mixture is usually effected 
under a flux, or some material that will 
promote liquefaction and prevent vola- 
tilization and unnecessary exposure to 
the air. Thus, in melting lead and tin 
together for solder, rosin or tallow is 
thrown upon the surface is rubbed with 
sal ammoniac'; and in combining some 
metals, powdered charcoal is used for 
the same purpose. Mercury or quick- 
silver combines with many metals m the 
cold, forming amalgams, or easily fusible 
alloys (q. v.). 

Alloys generally possess characteris- 
tics unshared by their component metals. 

£- U i' co PP er an d zinc form brass, 
which has a different density, hardness, 
and color from either of its constituents. 
Whether the metals tend to unite in 
atomic proportions or in any definite 
ratio is still undetermined. The evi- 
dence afforded by the natural alloys of 
gold and silver, and by the phenomena 
acco m p an yi n{! the cooling of several 
alloys from the state of fusion, goes far 
«> prove that such is the case (Rud- 
Der g). The subject is, however, one of 
«jnaiderable difficulty, as metals and 
metallic compounds are generally solu- 
f e . la each other, and unite by simple 
oni? and contac t- That they do not 
combine indifferently with each other, 
tut j?".^ 36 a species of elective affinity 
Q( Jt dissimilar to other bodies, is clearly 



shown by the homogeneity and superior 
quality of many alloys in which the 2 
stituent metals are in atorTic proportion 
The variation of the specific gravity and 
melting points of alloys from the mean 
of those of their component metals also 
affords strong evidence of a chemical 
change having taken place. Thus, alloys 
generally melt at lower temperatures than 
their separate metals. They also usually 
possess more tenacity and hardness than 
the mean ot their constituents. 

Matthiessen found that when weights 
are suspended to spirals of hard-drawn 
wire made of copper, gold, or platinum, 
they become nearly straightened when 
stretched by a moderate weight; but 
wires of equal dimensions composed of 
copper-tin (12 per cent of tin), siJver- 
platinum (30 per cent of platinum), and 
gold-copper (84 per cent of copper) scarce- 
ly undergo any permanent change in fora 
when subjected to tension by the same 
weight. 

The same chemist gives the following 
approximate results upon the tenacity 
of certain metals and wires hard-drawi 
through the same gauge (No. 23):

Copper, breaking strain 25-S( 

Tin, breaking strain .under

Silver (8.4% copper) 45-5C 

Platinum (8.4% copper) 45-51 

Silver-platinum (30% platinum) . 75-80 

On the other hand, the malleability, 
ductility, and power of resisting oxyge: 
of alloys is generally diminished. Th 
alloy formed of two brittle metals is 
always brittle; that of a brittle and a duc- 
tile metal, generally so; and even two 
ductile metals sometimes unite to form 
a brittle compound. The alloys formed 
of metals having different fusing points 
are usually malleable while cold and 
brittle while hot. The action of the a r 
on alloys is generally less than on their 
simple metals, unless the former are 
heated. A mixture of 1 part of tin and 
3 parts of lead is scarcely acted on at 
common temperatures; but at a .red ^eat 
it readily tafces, fire and continues to 
burn for some time like a piece of bad 
turf. In like manner, a mixture o f tin 
and zinc, when strongly heated, de- 
composes both moist air and steam with

Compounding Alloys.— Considerable 
experience is necessary to insure success 
in compounding alloys, especially when 
tne metals employed vary greatly in 
fusibility and volatility. The following 
are rules supplied by an experienced 
workman:

have been obtained. 0 

3. The surface of all oxidizable metal 
should be covered with some protects 
agent, as tallow for very fusible one? 
rosin for lead and tin, charcoal for zinc! 
copper, etc. ^ 

4. Stir the metal before casting and 
if possible, when casting, with a white- 
wood stick; this is much better for the 
purpose than an iron rod. 

5. If possible, add a small portion of 
old alloy to the new. If the alloy is re- 
quired to make sharp castings and 
strength is not a very great object, the 

Eroportion of old alloy to the new should 
e increased. In all cases a new or 
thoroughly well-cleansed crucible should 
be used. 

To obtain metals and metallic alloys 
from their compounds, such as oxides, 
sulphides, chlorides, etc., a process lately 
patented makes use of the reducing 
qualities of aluminum or its alloys witn 
magnesium. The finely powdered ma- 
terial (e.g., chromic oxide) is placed in a 
crucible mixed with aluminum oxide. 
The mixture is set afire by means of a 
soldering pipe or a burning magnesium 
wire, and the desired reaction takes place. 
For igniting, one may also employ with 
advantage a special priming cartridge 
consisting of pulverized aluminum to 
which a little magnesium may be mixed, 
and peroxide of magnesia, which is 
shaped into balls and lighted wjtJi & 
magnesium wire. By suitable additions 
to the pulverized mixture, alloys 
taining aluminum, magnetism, 
mium, manganese, copper, iron, 
silicic acid, etc., are obtained.

ALUMINUM ALLOYS.

4; 



The alloys with 93, 95, and 98 per cent have 
densities of 2.745, 8.674, and 2.600 re- 
spectively, and melting points near that 
of aluminum. Their color is like that 
of aluminum, but they are less lustrous. 
£D are malleable, easily cut, softer than 
a l um jnum, and have granular fracture. 
On remelting they become somewhat 
richer in lead, through a tendency to 
•quation. They do not oxidize in moist 
t, nor at their melting points. They 
re attacked in the cold by hydrochloric 
nd bv strong sulphuric acid, with evo- 
"ution of hydrogen, and by strong nitric 
cid when hot" strong solution of po- 
tassium hydroxide also attacks them. 
They are without action on distilled 
ater, whether cold or hot. 
Zinc. — Well-defined alloys were ob- 
tained, corresponding to the formulas 
Zn,Al, Zn,AJ, ZnAI, ZnAl 2 , ZnAla, 
ZnAh, ZnAU, ZnAl 10 , ZnAl ls . Their 
melting points and densities all lie be- 
tween those of zinc and aluminum, and 
those containing most zinc are the hard- 
est. They are all dissolved by cold 
hydrochloric acid and by hot dilute nitric 
acid. Cold concentrated nitric acid at- 
tacks the first three, and cold dilute acid 
the first five. The Zn a Al, ZnAl 6 , ZnAl 10 , 
and ZnAl, 2 are only slightly affected by 
cold potassium-hydroxide solution; the 
others are strongly attacked, potassium 
zincate and aluminate probably being 
formed. 

Tin. — A filed rod of tin-aluminum alloy 
plunged in cold water gives off for some 
minutes bubbles of gas, composed of 
hydrogen and oxygen in explosive pro- 
portions. An unfiled rod, or a filed rod 
of either aluminum or tin, is without 
action, though the unfiled rod of alloy 
will act on boiling water. The filed rod 
of alloy, in faintly acid solution of cop- 
per or zinc sulphate, becomes covered 
with a deposit of copper or zinc, while 
bubbles of oxygen are given off. M. 
I | ccheux believes that the metals are truly 
alloyed only at the surface, and that filing 
'ays bare an almost infinitely numerous 
series of junctions of the two metals, 
"Which, heated by the filing, act as ther- 
mocouples. 

1 bismuth.— By the method used for 
lead, bismuth alloys were obtained con- 
taining 75, 85, 88, and 94 per cent of 
aluminum, with densities 2.86, 2.79, 
and 2.74 respectively. They were 
sonorous, brittle, finely ' grained, and 
homogeneous, silver-white, and with 
melting points between those of their con- 
stituents, but nearer that of aluminum. 
-Lhey are not sxidized in air at the tem- 



perature of casting, but are readily at 
tacked by acids, concentrated or dilute 

TV, m 7 A P^^-hydroxide «olu Ton 
The filed alloys behave like those of tin 
but still more markedly. 

-n ag ^ esi ^ m -- These w«e obtain 
with 66, 68, 78 77, and 85 per cent 
ot aluminum, and densities % 24 2 47 
2.32, 2.37, 2.47. They are brittle, witl 
large granular fracture, silver-white fil< 
well, take a good polish, and Jiave melt 
ing points near that of aluminum 
Being viscous when melted, they are dif- 
ficult to cast, and when slowly cooled 
form a gray, spongy mass which cannot 
be remelted. They do not oxidize ir 
air at the ordinary temperatures, bi 
burn readily at a bright-red heat. The,, 
are attacked violently by acids and bj 
potassium-hydroxide solution, decom- 
pose hydrogen peroxide, and slowly de 
compose water even in the cold. 

Tin, Bismuth, and Magnesium.— The 
action of water on these alloys just re- 
ferred to has been recently demonstrated 
on a larger scale, 5 to 6 cubic centimeters 
of hydrogen having been obtained in 2C 
minutes from 2 cubic centimeters of the 
filed tin alloy. The bismuth alloy yiel< 
ed more hydrogen than the tin alloy, anc 
the magnesium alloy more than the bis 
muth alloy. The oxygen of the decoi 
posed water unites with the aluminui 
Larger quantities of hydrogen are ot 
tained from copper-sulphate solution, 
apart from the decomposition of thr 
solution by precipitation of copper at tl 
expense of the metal alloyed with the 
aluminum. The alloys of aluminum 
with zinc and lead do not decompose 
pure water, but do decompose the wat€ 
of copper-sulphate solution, and, more 
slowly, that of zinc-sulphate solution. 

Aluminum is a metal whose properties 
are very materially influenced by a pro- 
portionately small addition of copper. 
Alloys of 99 per cent aluminum and 1 
cent of copper are hard, brittle, and blu 
in color; 95 percent of aluminum and 
per cent of copper give an alloy which ca 
Ke hammered, but with 10 per cent of cop- 
per the metal can no longer be worM

As the proportion of copper increases,

stretXd out into thin sheets between 
rollers, worked under the hammer, and 
shaped as desired by beating or pressure, 
in powerful stamping presses. Un ac- 
count of its hardness it takes a fine pol- 
ish, and its peculiar greemsh-gold I color 
resembles that of gold alloyed with cop- 
per and silver together. 

Alloys with a still greater proportion ot 
copper approach this metal more and 
more nearly in their character; the color 
of an alloy, for instance, composed of 
95 per cent of copper and 5 per cent ot alu- 
minum, can be distinguished from pure 
gold only by direct comparison, and the 
metal is very hard, and also very mal- 
leable. 

Electrical Conductivity of Aluminum 
Alloys.— During three years' exposure to 
the atmosphere, copper-aluminum alloys 
in one test gradually diminished in con- 
ductivity in proportion to the amount of 
copper they contained. The nickel-copper 
aluminum alloys, which show such re- 
markably increased tensile strength as 
compared with good commercial alumi- 
num, considerably diminished in total con- 
ductivity. On the other hand, the man- 
ganese-copper aluminum alloys suffered 
comparatively little diminution in total 
conductivity, and one of them retained 
comparatively high tensile strength. It 
was thought that an examination of 
the structure of these alloys by aid of 
microphotography might throw some 
light on the great difference which exists 
between some of their physical proper- 
ties. For instance, a nickel-copper alu- 
minum alloy has 1.6 times the tensile 
strength of ordinary commercial alumi- 
num. Under a magnification of 800 
diameters practically no structure could 
be discovered. Considering the re- 
markable crystalline structure exhibited 



by ordi nary commercial aluminum near 
trie surface of an ingot, when allowed to 
solidity at an ordinary rate, the want of 

nV^ t Ure + u m these all °y s must be attrib- 
uted to the process of drawing down. 

inference is that the great differ- 
ence which exists between their tensile 

to variation in structure.

riages, bicycles, and motor vehicles. 
The French call it partinium; the com- 
position of the new alloy varies according 
to the purposes for which it is used. It 
is considera bly cheaper than aluminum, 
almost as light, and has a greater resist-

sequently required when they are used. 
I, — An anti-friction metal of excellent 
ua ']ity and one that has been used with 
success is made as follows : 17 parts 
zinc; 1 pa rt copper; 1* parts antimony; 
prepared in the following way: Melt the 
copper in a small crucible, then add the 
antimony, and lastly the zinc, care being 
taken not to burn the zinc. Burning 
can be prevented by allowing the copper 
and antimony to cool slightly before add- 
ing the zinc. This metal is preferably 
cast into the shape desired and is not 
used as a lining metal because it requires 
too great a heat to pour. It machines 
nicely and takes a fine polish on bearing 
surfaces. It has the appearance of 
aluminum when finished. Use a lubri- 
cating oil made from any good grade of 
machine oil to which 3 parts of kerosene 
have been added. 

II. — Copper, 6 parts; tin, 12 parts; 
lead, 150 parts; antimony, 30 parts; 
wrought iron, 1 part; cast iron, "1 part. 
For certain purposes the composition is 
modified as follows: Copper, ICS parts; 
tin, 40 parts; lead, 120 parts; antimony, 
24 parts; wrought iron, 1 part; cast iron, 
1 part. In both cases the wrought iron 
is cut up in small pieces, and in this state 
it will melt readily in fused copper and 
cast iron. After the mixture lias been 
well stirred, the tin, lead, and antimony 
are added; these are previously melted in 
separate crucibles, and when mingled the 
whole mass is again stirred thoroughly. 
Ihc product may then be run into ingots, 
to be employed when needed. When 
run mto the molds the surface should be 
well skimmed, for in this state it oxidizes 
rapidly. The proportions may be varied 
without materially affecting the results.

J*— Melt together copper, 100 parts; 
« 35 parts. After being cast into the 
required object, it should be made red- 
hoi and then plunged immediately mto 
cold water in order to impart to it the 
requite degree of sonorousness. For 
cymbals and gongs. 

XII —Melt together copper, 80 parts, 
tin 20 parts. When cold it has to be 
hammered out with frequent annealing. 

XIII. — Copper, 78 parts; tin, 22 parts, 
This is superior to the former, and it can 
be rolled out. For tam-tams and gongs. 

XIV. — Melt together copper, 72 parts ; 
tin, 26 to 56 parts; iron A part. Lscd 
in making the bells of ornamental French 
clocks. 

Castings in bell metal are all more or 
less brittle; and, when recent, have a 
color varying from a dark ash-gray to 
grayish- white, which is darkest in the 
more cuprous varieties, in which it 
turns somewhat on the yellowish-red or 
bluish-red. The larger the proportion 
of copper in the alloy, the deeper and 
graver the tone of the bells formed of 
it. The addition of tin, iron, or zinc, 
causes them to give out their tones sharp- 
er. Bismuth and lead are also often 
used to modify the tone, which each 
metal affects differently. The addition 
of antimony and bismuth is frequently 
made by the founder to give a more crys- 
talline grain to the alloy. All these 
conditions are, however, prejudicial to 
the sonorousness of bells, and of very 
doubtful utility. Rapid refrigeration 
increases the sonorousness of all these 
alloys. Hence M. D'Arcet recommends 
that the "pieces" be heated to a cherry- 
red after tliey are cast, and after having 
been suddenly plunged into cold water, 
that they be submitted to well-regulated 
pressure by skillful hammering, until they 
assume their proper form; after which they 
are to be again heated and allowed to cool 
slowly in the air. This is the method 
adopted by the Chinese with their gongs, 
etc., a casing of sheet iron being em- 
ployed by them to support and protect 
the pieces during the exposure to heat. 
In a general way, however, bells are 
tormed and completed by simple casting, 
inis is necessarily the case with all very 
large bells. Where the quality of their 
tones is the chief object sought after, the 
greatest care should be taken to use com- 
medially pure copper. The presence 

JjJ J Uttle le , ad or an ? sin »lar metal 
greatly lessens the sonorousness of this 
alloy; while that of silver increases it. 
1 he specific gravity of a large bell is 



seldom uniform thTougn its whole 
stance; nor can the specific gravity f 
any given portion of its constituent 
als be exactly calculated owing to tl 
many interfering circumstances tl" 5 
nearer this uniformity is approached 
in other words, chemical combination 0 ;; 
complete, the more durable and fin 
toned will be the bell. In general it 
found necessary to take about one-tenrt! 
more metal than the weight of the i 
tended bell, or bells, in order to allo^v fo~ 
waste and scorification during the opera 1 
tions of fusing and casting. : 

BISMUTH ALLOYS.

posed of tin, 48 parts; lead, 32.5; bis- 
muth, 9; and antimony, 10.5. It is es- 
pecially well adapted to dabbing rollers 
for printing cotton goods, and as it pos- 
sesses a considerable degree of hardness, 
it wears well. H

of the cements in ordinary use are dis- 
solved, or at least softened, by petro- 
leum. An alloy of lead S parts, tin 2,

Alartrer percentage of aluminum makes

must be cooled slowly or they will be

its low price, combined with its excellent 
flualities, would seem to make it in many 
cases an advantageous substitute for the 
expensive phosphorous bronze. 

Bristol Brass (Prince's Metal).— This 
alloy, which possesses properties similar 
to those of French brass, is prepared in 
the following proportions: 

I II III 

Copper 75.7 67. 2 60.8 

Zinc 24.3 32.8 39.2 

Particular care is required to prevent 
the zinc from evaporating during the fus- 
ing, and for this purpose it is customary 
to put only half of it into the first melting, 
and to add the remainder when the first 
mass is liquefied. 

Brass -Iron (Aich's Metal). — This is 
a variety of brass with an admixture of 
iron, which gives it a considerable degree 
of tenacity. It is especially adapted for 
purposes which require a hard and, at 
the same time, tenacious metal. Analyses 
of the various kinds of this metal show 
considerable variation in the proportions. 
Even the amount of iron, to which the 
hardening effect must be attributed, may 
vary within wide limits without materi- 
ally modifying the tenacity which is the 
essential characteristic of this alloy.

The great value of this alloy He* ,*« i + 

S't?*^ T^V 3 ^ Ualed only by ?l5 
of the best steel. As an illustratmn o 
this, a wrought-iron pipe broke with 
pressure of 267 atmospheres, while a 
similar pipe of sterro metal withstood thfe 
enormous pressure of 763 atmospheres 
without cracking. Besides its remark- 
able strength, it possesses a high decree 
ot elasticity, and is, therefore, particular- 
ly suitable for purposes which require 
the combination of these two qualities, 
such as the construction of hydraulic 
cylinders. It is well known that these 
cylinders, at a certain pressure, begin tc 
sweat, that is, the interior pressure is sc 
great that the water permeates througl 
the pores of the steel. With a sterrc 
metal cylinder, the pressure can be con- 
siderably increased without any mois- 
ture being perceptible on the outside of 
the cylinder. 

Sterro metal can be made even more 
hard and dense, if required for special 
purposes, but this is effected rather bj 
mechanical manipulation than by anj 
change in the chemical composition. I 
rolled or hammered in heat, its strength 
is increased, and it acquires, in addition, 
an exceedingly high degree of tenacity. 
Special care must be taken, however, m 
hammering not to overheat the metal, 
as in this case it would become brittle and 
might crack under the hammer. Sterro 
metal is especially suitable for all the 
purposes for which the so-called red 
metal has been in the past almost ex- 
clusively used. Axle bearings, for ex- 
ample, made of sterro metal have such 
excellent qualities that many machine 
factories are now using this material 
entirely for the purpose.

bronze, so called, statuettes c ock case*

alloy and one which will cut free and is 
stroL H * stronger alloy be desired, 
more tin may be aided, but 4 ounce, is 
dually sufficient. If the alloy be too 
hard, reduce the proportion ot tin. 

Leaf Brass.— This alloy is also called 
Dutch gold, or imitation gold leal. It 
is made of copper, 77.75 to 84.5 parts; 
zinc; 15.5 to 22.25. Its color is pale or 
bright yellow or greenish, according to 
the proportions of the metals. It has an 
unusual degree of ductility. 

Malleable Brass.— This metal is af- 
fected less by sea water than pure copper, 
and was formerly much used for ship 
sheathing, and for making nails and 
rivets which were to come in contact with 
sea water. At the present day it has 
lost much of its importance, since all the 
larger ships are made of steel. It is 
usually composed of copper, 60 to 6£ 
parts; and zinc, 40 to 38 parts. It is 
sometimes called yellow metal, or Miintz 
metal (called after its inventor), and is 
prepared with certain precautions, di- 
rected toward obtaining as fine a grain 
as possible, experience having shown, 
that only a fine-grained alloy of uniform 
density can resist the action of the sea 
water evenly. A metal of uneven den- 
sity will wear in holes. To obtain as 
uniform a grain as possible, small sam- 
ples taken from the fused mass are cooled 
quickly and examined as to fractUTe. If 
they do not show the desired uniform 
grain, some zinc is added to the mass. 
After it has permeated the whole mass, 
a fresh sample is taken and tested, this 
being continued until the desired result 
is reached. It is scarcely necessary to 
remark that considerable experience is 
required to tell the correct composition 
of the alloy from the fracture. The mass 
is finally poured into molds and rolled 
cold. Malleable brass can be worked 
warm, like iron, being ductile in heat, a 
valuable quality.

are thrown into the liquid mass until it 
no longer shows a reflecting surface 
when it is cast into ingots in iron molds! 
The ingots are plunged into water while 
still red-hot, and acquire by this treat- 
ment a very high degree of ductility. The 
alloy, properly prepared, has a fibrous 
fracture and a reddish-yellow color. 

Sheet Brass (For Sheet and Wire).— 
In the preparation of brass far the manu- 
facture of wire, an especially pure qual- 
ity of copper must be used; without this, 
all efforts to produce a suitable quality of 
brass will be in vain. That pure copper 
is indispensable to the manufacture of 
good, ductile brass may be seen from the 
great difference in the composition of the 
various kinds, all of which answer their 
purpose, but contain widely varying 
quantities of copper and zinc. The fol- 
lowing table shows the composition ot 
some excellent qualities of brass suitable 
for making sheet and wire:

Britannia metal is prepared by meltin 
the copper alone first, then adding 
part of the tin and the whole of the an- 
timony. The heat can then be quickl 
moderated, as the melting point of th 
new alloy is much lower than that o 
copper. Finally, the rest of the tin „ 
added, and the mixture stirred constant 
for some time to make it thoroughly 
homogeneous. 

An alluy_ which bears a resemblance 
to Britannia metal is Ashberry metal, 
for which there are two formulas.

BRONZES. 

The composition of bronze must b 
effected immediately before the casting, 
for bronze cannot be kept in store ready 
prepared. In forming the alloy, the re- 
fractory compound, copper, is first melted 
separately, the other metals, tin, zinc, 
etc., previously heated, being then 
added; the whole is then stirred and tiie 
casting carried out without loss of time. 
The process of forming the alloy must De 
effected quickly, so that there may be no 
loss of zinc, tin, or lead through oxida- 
tion, and also no interruption to the 
flow of metal, as metal added after an 
interval of time will ^ ooinbme j»g

before reaching the copper. wnen «i« 
Si arc made, they must be cooled 
as amckfv as possible, for the compo- 
ae n ?s of SonzeVve a tendency to form 



Separate alloys of VBiious <jmpo a ition, 
thus producing the so-called tin spots 
This S much more likely to occur with a 
]S than with a sudden cooling of the 
mass. 

Annealing Bronze. -This, Process is 
more particularly employed in the prep- 
aration^ of alloys used in the manufacture 
of cymbals, gongs, bells, etc. The alloy 
is naturally brittle, and acquires the 
properties essential to the purpose for 
which it is intended only after casting. 
The instruments are plunged into cold 
water while red-hot, hammered, re- 
heated, and slowly cooled, when they 
become soft and sonorous. The alloy 
of copper and tin has the peculiar prop- 
erty that, whereas steel becomes hard 
through cooling, this mixture, when 
cooled suddenly, becomes noticeably soft 
and more malleable. The^ alloy is 
heated to a dark-red heat, or, in the case 
of thin articles, to the melting point of 
lead, and then plunged in cold water. 
The alloy may be hammered without 
splitting or breaking. 

Aluminum Bronze. — This is prepared 
by melting the finest copper in a cruci- 
ble, and adding the aluminum. The 
copper is cooled thereby to the thickly 
fluid point, but at the moment of the 
combination of the two metals, so much 
heat is released that the alloy becomes 
white hot and thinly fluid. Aluminum 
bronze thus prepared is usually brittle, 
and acquires its best qualities only after 
having been remelted several times. It 
may be remarked that, in order to obtain 
a bronze of the best quality, only the very 
purest copper must be used; with an infe- 
rior quality of copper, all labor is wasted. 
Aluminum bronze is not affected by ex- 
posure to the air; and its beautiful color 
makes it very suitable for manufactur- 
ing various ornamental articles, includ- 
ing clock cases, door knobs, etc. 

Aluminum bronze wire is almost as 
strong as good steel wire, and castings 
made from it are almost as hard as steely 
to bending or sag- 



iron; rts resistance 
ging is great. 



. I \"~" A .g° od formula is 90 to 95 per cent 
of : aluminum and 5 to 10 per cent of cop- 
per, of golden color, which keeps well m 
tne air, without soon becoming dull and 
changing color like pure copper and iS 



alloys with tin and zinc (bronze V, 
etc.). It can be cast excellently 
filed well and turned, possesses a 7 
traordmary hardness and firmness 
attains a high degree of Tjolish ■ ' if ^ 
malleable and forgeable. On the hV 
quality are founded applications vh\i 
were formerly never thought of v 
forged works pf art for decorative tJw 
poses. An alloy of 95 parts alu,^, 
and 5 parts copper is used here. Th 



technical working of bronze is not m i 
rially different from that of iron Th" 
metal, especially in a hot condition i> 
worked like iron on the anvil, with ham 
mer and chisel, _ only that the tempera" 
ture to be maintained in forging lies 
between dark and light cherry red. Jj 
the articles are not forged in one piece 
and the putting together of the separate 
parts becomes necessary, riveting or 
soldering has to be resorted to. Besides 
forging, aluminum bronze is well suited 
for embossing, which is not surprising con- 
sidering the high percentage of copper. 
After finishing the pieces, the metal can 
be toned in manifold ways by treatment 
with acid. 

II. — Copper, 89 to 98 per cent; alu- 
minum and nickel, 1 to S per cent. Alu- 
minum and nickel change in the opposite 
way, that is to say, in increasing the per- 
centage of nickel the amount of alu- 
minum is decreased by the equal quan- 
tity. It should be borne in mind that the 
best ratio is aluminum, 9.5 per cent; 
nickel, 1 to 1.5 per cent at_ most. In 
preparing the alloy a deoxidizing agent 
is added, viz., phosphorus to 0.5 per 
cent; magnesium to 1.5 per cent. I he 
phosphorus should always he added in 



the form of phosphorous copper or phos- 

V determined

phor aluminum of exactly determine

copper, then the aluminum and tne

■ Statuary Bronze. — Many of the an- 
tique statues were made of genuine 
bronze, which has advantages for this 
purpose, but has been superseded in 
modern times by mixtures of metals 
containing, besides copper and tin — the 
constituents of real bronze — a quantity 
of zinc, the alloy thus formed being 
really an intermediate product between 
bronze and brass. The reason for the 
use of such mixtures lies partly in the 
comparative cheapness of their produc- 
tion as compared with genuine bronze, 
and partly in the purpose for which the 
metal ls to be used. A thoroughly good 
statuary bronze must become thinly fluid 
m fusing, fill the molds out sharply, allow

much tin makes the alloy brittle and (

The best proportions for statuar 
bronze are very definitely known at ti 
present day; yet it sometimes happei 
that large castings have not the rig! 
character. They are either defective i 
color, or they dc not take on a fine patim 
or they are difficult to chisel. Thes 
phenomena may be due to the use 
impure metals — containing oxides, iroi 
lead, etc.-^or to improper treatment 
the alloy in melting. With the m< 
careful work possible, there is a consit 
erable loss in melting — 3 per cent at tl 
very least, and sometimes as much as i 
This is due to the large proportion

manufacture. 

It has been remarked that slight vai 
ations in composition quickly ehan« 
the color of the alloy. The following
