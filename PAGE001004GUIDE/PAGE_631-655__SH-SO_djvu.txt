2toiTthe proportion of 1 part to 20 
2 shellac is sufficient Great cau- 
5™ is recommended in the handling of 
ether The ether vapors easily ignite 
when' in proximity to a burning light and 
a mixture of ether vapor and atmos- 
pheric air may cause most vehement ex- 
plosions. After an action of the ether 
upon the shellac for several hours, the 
alcohol necessary to dissolve it may either 
be added directly or the shellac mois- 
teaed with ether is placed in the open air 
for half an hour in a dish, after which 
time the ether will have evaporated and 
tie shellac can then be dissolved by the 
use of alcohol. 

Bleached shellac is known to lose its 
solubility in alcohol, especially if treated 
with chlorine in bleaching. This solu- 
bility can be readily restored, however, 
by first mositening the rosin with its 
weight of ether, placing it in a closed 
vessel and allowing it to swell there. 
Shellac thus treated becomes perfectly 
soluble again.

Put in a kettle and under gentle heat 
stir together until a smooth, homoge- 
neous mass has been attained. In an- 
other kettle put 3 parts of finely shredded 
gutta percha and warm over an open fire 
until it begins to run, then add, with 
constant stirring, 5 parts of olive oil, 
continuing the heat until the gum is 
completely dissolved. When this oc- 
curs dissolve in 1 part of stearine, and 
add the whole while still hot in a slow 
stream, and under diligent and constant 
stirring, to the mixture of syrup and 
blacks. Continue the agitation of the 
mass until it is completely homogeneous. 
Now dissolve 4 parts of Senegal gum in 
12 parts of water, and add the solution to 
the foregoing mass. Stir well in. and 
finally add sufficient mirbane (about 
£ pari) to perfume. 

Blacking Pastes.— While shellac is not 
soluble in water alone, it is soluble in water 
carrying borax, the alkaline carbonates, 
etc. In paste blacking the object of the 
sulphuric acid is to remove from the bone 
black the residual calcium phosphate. 
The ordinary bone black of commerce 
consists of only about 10 per cent of 
carbon, the residue being chiefly calcium 
phosphate. This is the reason that we 
cannot obtain a pure Uack color from it. 
but a dirty brown. To make a good 
Hacking, one that is of a black in color 
either use purified bone black, or a

sodium carbonate in sufficient water to 
make a cold saturated solution (about 
3 parts of water at 60° P.), and set aside. 
In an earthenware vessel moisten the 
bone black with a very little water, and 
stirring it about with a stick, add the 
sulphuric acid, slowly. Agitate until a 
thick dough-like mass is obtained, then 
add and incorporate the fish oil. Any 
sort of animal oil, or even colza will 
answer, but it is best to avoid high-smell- 
ing oils. Add a little at a time, and 
under vigorous stirring, sufficient of the 
saturated sodium carbonate solution to 
cause effervescence. Be careful not to 
add so freely as to liquefy the mass. Stir 
until effervescence ceases, then add the 
molasses or sugar, the first, if a soft, 
damp paste is desired, and the latter if 
a dryer one is wanted. Finally, add, a

To render this preservative effective, 
the soles must be coated with it until 
the leather absorbs it. 

_ II.— Dissolve ordinary household soap 
m water; on the other hand, dissolve an 
aluminum salt — the cheapest ia the com- 
mercial aluminum sulphate — in water 
and allow both^ solutions to cool. Now 
pour the aluminum salt solution, with 
constant stirring, into the soap solution, 
thereby obtaining a very 6ne precipitate 
of aluminum oleate. The washed-out 
residue is dried with moderate heat. By 
adding 10 to 30 per cent to petroleum 
with slight heating, a solid petroleum of 
vaseline-like consistency is received, 
which may be still further solidified by 
additional admixture. A 10 per cent 
solution of aluminum oleate in petro- 
leum is a very excellent agent for pre- 
serving the soles, a single saturation of 
the soles sufficing forever. The sole will 
last about 1 year. 

III. — The following mixture is pre- 
pared by melting together over the fire 
in an enameled iron vessel: Vaseline, 
400 parts; ceresine, 100 parts. The 
melted mass, which is used as a grease, 
is filled in wooden boxes or tin cans. 

IY, — The oleic acid of the stCarine 
factories is heated with strong alcohol 
and sulphuric acid. Take 16 parts of 
oleic acid, 3 parts of alcohol (90 per 
cent), and 1 part of concentrated sulphu- 
ric acid. The oleic-acid ether formed 
separates as a thin brownish oil. It is 
liberated from free sulphuric acid and 
the alcohol in excess by agitation wit 
warm water and allowing to settle. Ihi 

oleic-acid ether is ^fZ \ lrT s ol 
weight of fish oil, and 4 to 8 parts of 
nitro-benzol are added per 1,000 parts to 
disguise the odor.

Proceed as above. 

Carnauba wax is often used by manu- 
facturers of such dressings instead of 
beeswax, as it is harder and takes a 
higher polish. These dressings are 
sometimes colored with finely ground 
yellow ocher or burnt umber. _ If the 
leather be badly worn, however, it is best 
to apply a stain first, and afterwards the 
waxy dressing. 

Suitable stains are made by boiling 
safflower in water, and annatto is also 
used in the same way, the two being 
sometimes mixed together. Oxalic acid 
darkens the color of the safflower. Ani- 
line colors would also doubtless wM 
good results with less trouble and » 
pense. By adding finely ground Imp 
black to the waxy mixture instead of 
ocher, it would answer as a dressing

TO PREVENT DIM- { 



Siccatives 



The oldest drier is probably litharge, 
a reddish -yellow powder, consisting of 
lead and oxygen. Formerly it was 
ground finely m oil, either pure or with 
admixture of white vitriol and added to 
the dark oil paints. Litharge and sugar 
of lead are used to-day only rarely as 
drying agents, having been displaced by 
the liquid manganese siccatives, which 
are easy to handle. E. Ebelin, however, 
is of the opinion that the neglect of the 
lead compounds has not been beneficial 
to decorative painting. Where these 
mediums were used in suitable quantities 
hard-drying coatings were almost always 
obtained. Ebelin believes that formerly 
there used to be less lamentation on 
account of tacky floors, pews, etc., than 
at the present time. 

i-x-P 0uf3t ! ess a proposition to grind 
litharge into the oil again will not be 
favorably received, although some old 

£t? e 5 &* ,nters , have by no means dis- 
carded this method. 

Sugar of lead (lead acetate) is likewise 
tt as a drier for oil paint. While we 

act! f f - Ume l ? ge - neral that a siccative 
by imparting its oxygen to the lin- 

such J m« P^pares the linseed oil in 

lUv & render 5t Wble of 



strengthens us in this belief t* 
cording to Leuchs a piece of chared" 
saturated with lead acetate, the char , 
can be ignited even with a bw^ 
sponge, and burns entirely to at fy! ng 
(Whoever desires to make the exr. ■' 
ment should take £ to 3 parts, by We [„u' 
of sugar of lead per 100 parts 0 f c fi 
coal.) This demonstrates that thesi/*" 
of lead readily parts with its oxvJr 
which though not burning itself S 
ports the combustion. Hence, it may t 
assumed that it will also as a siccative 
fi-cely give off its oxygen. 

Tormin reports on a siccative, of 
which he says that it has been found 
valuable for floor coatings. Its produc, 
tion is as follows: Pour 1 part of white 
lead and 1\ parts each of litharge, sugar 
of lead and red lead to \%\ parts of lb. 
seed oil, and allow this mixture to boil 
for 8 to 10 hours. Then remove tie 
kettle ifom the fire and add to the mix- 
ture 20 parts of oil of turpentine. During 
the boil big, as well as during and after 
the pouiing in of the oil turpentine, 
diligent stirring is necessary, partly to 

Erevent anything from sticking to the 
ettle (which would render the drier im- 
pure) and partly to cause the liquid 
mass to cool off sooner. After that, it is 
allowed to stand for a few days, whereby 
the whole will clarify- The upper layer 
is then poured off and added to the hffl 
tints, while the sediment may be used for 
the darker shades. 

If white vitriol (zinc sulphate or zinc 
vitriol) has been introduced among W 
drving agents, this is done in the en- 
deavor to create a non-coloring aom . 
ture for the white pigments and ftteqw

Kfainp! of equal parts of calcined

lanous acetate, and calcined zinc vitriol. 
g Of hi mixture 3 per cent is added to 
the zinc white. Of the other manganese 
compounds, especially that containing 
mostoxygen, viz., manganic peroxide, 3 
extensively employed. 1 his body IS 
Scaled as follows: It is first coarsely 
powdered, feebly calcined, and silted. 
Next, the substance is put into wire gauze 
and suspended in linseed oil, which 
should be boiled slightly. The weight 
of the linseed oil should be 10 times that 
of the manganese peroxide. 

According to another recipe a pure 
oilverous preparation may be produced 
jy treating the manganic peroxide with 
hydrochloric acid, next filtering, precipi- 
tating with hot borax solution, allowing 
to deposit, washing out and finally dry- 
ing. Further recipes will probably be 
unnecessary, since the painter will hardly 
prepare his own driers. 

Unless for special cases driers should 
be used but sparingly. As a rule 3 to 5 
per cent of siccative suffices; in other 
words, 3 to 5 pounds of siccative should 
be added to 100 pounds of ground oil 
paint ready for use. As a standard it 
niay be proposed to endeavor to have 
the coating dry in 24 hours. For lead 
colors a slight addition of drier is ad- 
visable; for red lead, it may be omitted 
altogether. Where non-tacky coatings 
are desired, as for floors, chairs, etc., as 
well as a priming for wood imitations, 
at ° ol ? r shoul d always be employed 
as toundation, and as a drier also a lead 
Preparation. On the other hand, no 
zin C0 1 n ?P° u nds should be used for pure 
"ic-wtute coats and white lacquering. 

C0 ^ estin e Siccatives. — Since it was dis- 
criJf , at the hmd and manganese 
impounds of rosin acids had a better 



and more rapid action on linaeed oil than 
the older form of driers, such as red 
lead, litharge, manganese dioxide, etc., 
the number of preparations of the former 
class has increased enormously. Man- 
ufacturers are continually at work en- 
deavoring to improve the quality of 
these compounds, and to obtain a prep- 
aration which will be peculiarly their 
own. Consequently, with such a large 
ety of substances to deal with, it

becomes a matter of some difficulty to 
distinguish the good from the bad. In 
addition to the general appearance, color, 
hardness, and a few other such physical 
properties, there is no means of ascer- 
taining the quality of these substances 
except practical testing of their drying 
properties, that is, one must mix the 
driers with oil and prove their value for 
oneself. Even the discovery of an ap- 
parently satisfactory variety does not end 
the matter, for experience has shown 
that such preparations, even when they 
appear the same, do not give simila 
results. A great deal depends upo 
their preparation; for example, manga 
nese resinate obtained from successiv 
consignments, and containing the sam 
percentage of manganese, does not al 
ways give identical results with oil. I 
fact, variation is the greatest drawbac 
to these compounds. With one prenar 
ation the oil darkens, with another 1 
remains pale, or sometimes decomposi- 
tion of the oil takes place m part. Lb 
addition of a small proportion of -lrie 
has been known to cause the separatio 
of 50 per cent of the oil as a dark vi'cou 
mass One drier will act well, ard th 
oil will remain thin, while with anothe 
the same oil will in the course of 1 re 
months thicken to the cojaurterqrj

Before proceeding to describe the 
method of P carrying out "egoxng 
tests, it is necessary ^emphasize the 



irnpnrtent" part which ^ Wed 
plays in the examination of the driers. 
As part of the information to be gamed 
by these tests depends upon the amount 
of solid matter which separates out, it is 
essential that the linseed oil should be 
uniform. To attain this end, the oil 
used must always be freed from muci- 
lage before being used for the test, it 
this cannot readily be obtained, ordinary 
linseed oil should be heated to a temper- 
ature of from 518° to 572° F., so that it 
breaks, and should then be cooled and 
filtered. With the ordinary market 
linseed oil, the amount of solid matter 
which separates varies within wide 
limits, so that if this were not removed, 
no idea of the separation of foot caused 
by the driers would be obtained. It is 
not to be understood from this that 
unbroken linseed oil is never to be used 
for ordinary paint or varnish, the warn- 
ing being only given for the sake of ar- 
riving at reliable values for the quality of 
the driers to be tested. 

A. — Solution of Drier in Linseed Oil. 
-—The precipitated metallic compounds 
of rosm (lead resinate, manganese res- 
mate and lead manganese resinate) dis- 
solve readily in linseed oil of ordinary 
temperature (60° to 70° P.). The oil is 
mixed with lfc per cent of the drier and 
subjected to stirring or shaking for 24 
tiours, the agitation being applied at 
intervals of au hour. Fused metallic res- 
mates are not soluble in linseed oil at or- 
dinars temperatures, so different treat- 
ffj*. re q"i™d for them. The oil is

settled, the _ amount of undissolved 
matter which is left at the bottom, as t jj£ 
is one of the data upon which an idea of 
the value of the drier must be formed 

B. — Solution of Drier in Turpentine 
or Benzine. — For the preparation of th ese 
liquid siccatives 1 to 1.4 parts of the 
metallic resinate or linoleate are added 
to the benzine or turpentine and dis- 
solved at a gentle heat, or the drier may 
first be melted over a fire and added to 
the solvent while in the liquid state. 
The proportion of matter which does not 
go into solution must be carefully noted 
as a factor in the valuation of the drier. 
From 5 to 10 per cent of the liquid sicca- 
tive is now added to the linseed oil, and 
the mixture shaken well, at intervals dur- 
ing 24 hours. 

Samples of all the oils prepared as 
above should be placed in small clear 
bottles, which are very narrow inside, so 
that a thin layer of the oil may be ob- 
served. The bottles are allowed to stand 
for 3 or 4 days in a temperate room, 
without being touched . When sufficient 
time has been allowed for thorough set- 
tling, the color, transparency, and con- 
sistency of the samples are carefully ob- 
served, and also the quantity and nature

SILK: 

Artificial "Rubbered" Silk. — A solu- 
tion of caoutchouc or similar gum in 
acetone is added, in any desired propor- 
tion, to a solution of nitre-cellulose in 
acetone, and the mixture is made into 
threads by passing it into water or other 
suitable liquid. The resulting threads 
are stated to be very brilliant in appear- 
ance, extremely elastic, and very resistant 
to the atmosphere and to -water. The 
product is not more inflammable than 
natural silk. 

Artificial Ageing of Silk Fabrics. — To 
give silk goods the appearance of age, 
exposure to the sun is the simplest way, 
but as this requires time it cannot always 
be employed. A quicker method con- 
sists in preparing a dirty-greenish liquor 
of weak soap water, with addition of a 
little blacking and gamboge solution. 
Wash the silk fabric in this liquor and 
dry as usual, without rinsing in clean 
water, and calender. 

Bleaching Silk.— The Lyons process of 
bleaching skeins of silk is to draw them 
T?- I tnr ? u gh a sort of aqua regia bath. 

t l i k ' s Prepared by mixing 5 parts 
« hydrochloric acid with i of nitric, 
leaving the mixture for 4 or 5 days at a 
gentle heat of about 77° F. } and then 
Quuting with about 15 times its volume 



of water. This dilution is effected in 
large tanks cut from stone. The tem- 
perature of the bath should be from 68° 
to 85° F., and the skeins should not be 
in it over 15 minutes, and frequently 
not so long as that; they must be kept in 
motion during all that time. When 
taken out, the silk is immediately im- 
mersed successively in 9, troughs of 
water, to remove every trace of the acid, 
after which they arc dried. 

Hydrogen peroxide is used as a silk 
bleach, the silk being first thoroughly 
washed with an alkaline soap and ammo- 
nium carbonate to free it of its gummy 
matter. After repeated washings in the 
peroxide (preferably rendered alkaline 
with ammonia and soda), the silk_ is 
"blued" with a solution of blue aniline 
in alcohol. 

Washing of Light Silk Goods —Tht 
best soap may change delicate tints. 
The following method is therefore pref- 
erable: First wash the silk tissue in warm 
milk. Prepare a light bran infusion, 
winch is to be decanted, and after resting 
for a time, passed over the fabric. It is 
then rinsed in this water, almost cold. 
It is moved about in all directions, anc 1 
afterwards dried on a napkin.

a blackish, earthy coating, the promi 
nent parts retaining a lead" e n but b right 
color. The process is simple. A thin paste 
is made of finely powdered graphite 
and oil of turpentine (a little blood- 
stone or red ocher may be added, to imi- 
tate the copper tinge in articles of old 
silver) and spread over the whole of the 
previously plated article. It is then 
allowed to dry, and the particles not ad- 
hering to the surface removed with a soft 
brush. The black coating should then 
be carefully wiped off the exposed parts 
by means of a linen rag dipped in alco- 
hol. This process is very effective in 
making imitations of objects of antique 
art, such as goblets, candlesticks, vessels 
of every description, statues, etc. If it 
is desired to restore the original bright- 
ness to the object, this can be done by 
washing with caustic soda or a solution 
of cyanide of potassium. Benzine can 
also be used for this purpose. 

Blanching Silver. — I. — Mix pow- 
dered charcoal, 3 parts, and calcined 
borax, 1 part, and stir with water so as 
to make a homogeneous paste. Apply 
this paste on the pieces to be blanched. 
Put the pieces on a charcoal fire, taking 
care to cover them up well; when they 
have acquired a cherry red, withdraw 
them from the fire and leave to cool off. 
■Next place them in a hot bath composed 
ot 9 parts of water and 1 part of sul- 
furic acid, without causing the bath to 
boil. .Leave the articles in for about 1 
hour. Remove them, rinse in clean 
water, and dry,

to the soldering and consequently xxyl 
spoil the piece. 1 

Coloring Silver —A rich gold tint ma 7 
be imparted to silver articles by plung 
ing them into_ dilute sulphuric acid 
saturated with iron rust. 1 

Frosting Polished Silver.— Articles of 
polished silver may be frosted by putting 
them into a bath of nitric acid diluted 
with an equal volume of distilled water 
and letting them remain a few minutes. 
A better effect may be given by dipping 
the article frequently into the bath until 
the requisite degree of frosting has been 
attained. Then rinse and place for a 
few moments in a strong bath of potas- 
sium cyanide; remove and rinse. The 
fingers must not be allowed to touch the 
article during either process. It should 
be held with wooden forceps or [.damps. 

Fulminating Silver. — Dissolve 1 part 
of fine silver in 10 parts of nitric acid of 
1.36 specific gravity at a moderate heat 1 , 
pour the solution into 20 parts of spirit 
of wine (85 to 90 per cent) and heat the 
liquid. As soon as the mixture begins 
to boil, it is removed from the fire and 
left alone until cooled off. The fulminic 
silver crystallizes on cooling in very fine 
needles of dazzling whiteness, which are 
edulcorated with water and dried care- 
fully in the air. 

Hollow Silverware. — A good process 
for making hollow figures consists m 
covering models of the figures, _ ninoe 
a base or easily soluble metal, witA awj* 
and uniform coating of a nobler metal, ^ 
means of the electric current in sue \_

Silver, so that while the zinc is being

ed on either side by the silver. .Similar 
precautions must be taken with other 
metals, regard being paid to their pecu- 
liar properties. Another method is to 
cast the figures, entire or m separate 
parts, out of some easily fusible alloy in 
chased metal molds. The separate por- 
tions are soldered with the same solder, 
and the figure is then provided with a 
coating of copper, silver, etc., by means 
of the galvanic current. It is then placed 
in boiling water or steam, and the inner 
alloys melted by the introduction of the 
water or steam through holes bored for 
this purpose. 

Lustrous Oxide on Silver (see also Plat- 
ing and Silver, under Polishes). — Some 
experience is necessary to reproduce a 
handsome black luster. Into a cup filled 
with water throw a little liver of sulphur 
and mix well. Scratch the silver article as 
hrieht as possible with the scratch brush 
and dip into the warm liquid. Remove 
the object after % minutes and rinse off 
in water. _ Then scratch it up again and 
return it into the liquid. The process 
should be repeated a or 3 times, whereby 
a wonderful glossy black is obtained. 

Ornamental Designs on Silver. — Select 
a smooth part of the silver, and sketch on 
« a monogram or any other design with 
a sharp lead pencil. Place the article in 
a ROld solution, with the battery in good 
working order, and in a short time all the 
Parts not sketched with the lead pencil 
will be covered with a coat of gold. After 
cleaning ,i , r , 



silver ornament is disclosed. A gold or- 
nament may be produced by reversing 
the process. 

Separating Silver from Platinum Waste. 

— Cut the waste into small pieces, make 
red hot to destroy grease and organic 
substances, and dissolve in aqua regia 
(hydrochloric acid, 3 parts, and nitric 
acid, 1 part). Platinum and all other 
metals combined with it are thus dis- 
solved, while silver settles on the bot- 
tom as chloride in the shape of a gray, 
spongy powder. The solution is then 
drawn off and tested by oxalic acid for 
gold, which is precipitated as a fine yel- 
lowish powder. The other metals re- 
main untouched thereby. The plati- 
num still present in the solution is now 
obtained by a gradual addition of sal 
ammoniac as a yellowish-gray powder. 
These different precipitates are washed 
with warm water, dried, and transformed 
into the metallic state by suitable fluxes. 
Platinum filings, however, have to be 
previously refined. They are also first 
annealed. All steel or iron filings are 
removed with a magnet and the rest is 
dipped into concentrated sulphuric acid 
and heated with this to the boiling point. 
This process is continued as long as an 
action of the acid is noticeable. < Ihe 
remaining powder is pure platinum. 
Hot sulphuric acid dissolves silver with- 
out touching the platinum. The liquid 
used for the separation of the platinum is 
now diluted with an equal quantity of 
water and the silver expelled from it by 
means of a saturated cooking ^ solu- 
tion. The latter is added gradual!; 
until no more action, i. e., separation, is 
nercePtible. The liquid is carefully 
Srawn off. the residue washed m , warm 
water dried and melted with a little 
Toda ashes as flux, which yields pure me- 

ta T C hfold process for separating 
from waste was as follows The refuse

COLORING SOAP. 

The first point to be observed k 
select the proper shade of fl 0Wer ™ 
responding with the perfume used fo> 
instance, an almond soap is left white 
rose soap is colored pink or red; rail 
gnonette, green, etc. 

The colors from which the soapmaker 
may select are numerous; not only are 
most of the coal-tar colors adapted for 
his purpose, but also a very great number 
of mineral colors. Until recently, the 
latter were almost exclusively employed, 
but the great advance in the tar-color 
industry has brought about a change. A 
prominent advantage of the mineral 
colors is their stability; they are not 
changed or in any way affected by ex- 
posure to light. This advantage, how- 
ever, is offset in many cases by the more 
difficult method of application, the diffi- 
culty of getting uniform shades. The 
coal-tar colors give brilliant shades and 
tints, are easy to use, and produce uni- 
form tints. The specific gravity ot 
mineral colors being rather high, in most 
cases they will naturally tend to seme 
toward the bottom of soap, and their use 
necessitates crutching of the soap im j 
is too thick to allow the color to setU& 
For mottled soap, however, vermU^j 
red oxide, and ultramarine are 
largely employed.

The following minerals, after being 

ground and washed several times m 

foiling water, will produce the colors 

stated: , 
Hematite produces deep red. 
Purple oxide iron produces purple. 
Oxide of manganese produces brown. 
Yellow ocher produces yellow. 
Yellow oeher calcined produces orange. 
Umber produces fawn. 
Cinnabar produces medium red. 
There are also a number of the azo 
dyes, which are suitable for soaps, and 
these, as well as the eosine colors, are 
used principally for transparent soaps. 
For opaque soaps both aniline and 
mineral reds are used, among the latter 
being vermilion, chrome red, and iron 
oxide. Chrome red is a basic chromate 
of lead, which is now much used in place 
of vermilion, but, as it becomes black on 
exposure to an atmosphere containing 
even traces only of sulphureted hydro- 
gen, it is not essentially adapted for soap. 
Vermilion gives a bright color, but its 
price is high. Iron oxide, known in the 
trade as colcothar, rouge, etc., is used 
for cheap soaps only. 

Among the natural colors for yellow 
are saffron, gamboge, turmeric, and 
caramel (sugar color) ; the first named of 
these is now hardly used, owing to its 
n 'gh cost. Of the yellow aniline colors 
special mention must be made of picric 
acid (trinitrophenol), martius yellow, 
japuthol yellow, acid yellow, and aura- 
tra ne " * an oran g e tint is wanted, a 
aJuj. ma genta or safranine may be 
added to the yellow colors named. The 
tW * 1° me un bleached palm oil with 
the ? l an , sw ers a similar purpose, but 
v«*ll ■ fa des on exposure. A mineral 
' ow 13 chrome yellow (chromate of 



h^ad), which has the same advantages 
and disadvantages as chrome red. 

Of the blue aniline colors, there may 
be used alkali blue, patent blue, and 
indigo extract. Alkali or aniline blue is 
soluble only in alkaline liquids; while 
patent blue is soluble in water and in 
alcohol. Both blues can be had in 
different brands, producing from green 
blues to violet blues. Indigo extract, 
which should be classed among the 
natural colors rather than among the tar 
colors, is added to the soap in aqueous 
solution. 

Of ultramarine there are two modifica- 
tions, the sulphate and the soda. Both 
of these are proof against the action of 
alkali, but are decomposed by acids or 
salts having an acid reaction. The 
former is much paler than the latter; tht 
soda ultramarine is best adapted 
coloring soda soaps blue. The ul. 
marine is added to the soap in the fori 
of a fine powder. Smalt is unsuitable, 
although it gives soap a color of won- 
derful beauty < because a considerable 
quantity of it is required to produce a 
deep color, and, furthermore, it makes 
the soap rough, owing to the gritty 
nature which smalt has even when in the 
finest powder. By mixing the blue anc 
yellow colors named, a great variety c 
greens are obtained. Both componei 
colors must be entirely free from an 
reddish tint, for the latter would caus 
the mixture to form a dirty-green color 
Of the colors producing green directij 
the two tar colors, Victoria and brilliar 
green, are to be noted; these give a brigl 
color, but fade rapidly; thereby the soa 
acquires an unsightly appearance. * 
opaque soap of the better grades, gret 
ultramarine or chrome green are use 
Gray and black are produced by lamf 
black. For brown, there is Bismarc 
brown among the aniline colors ,n 
umber among the earthy pigments.

ful in spots made by rosins, oils, grease, 
etc. Should the spot be only partially 
removed by the first application, repeat. 

Glycerine Soaps. — Dr. Sarg's liquid 
glycerine soap consists of 334 parts of 
potash soda soap, and 666 parts of glyc- 
erine free from lime, the mixture being 
scented with Turkish rose oil and orange 
blossom oil in equal proportions, the 
actual amount used being varied accord- 
ing to taste. The soap should be per- 
fectly free from alkali; but as this is a 
condition difficult of attainment in the 
case of ordinary potash soaps, it is pre- 
supposed that the soap used has been 
salted out with potassium chloride, this 
being the only way to obtain a soap free 
from alkali. 

Another variety of liquid glycerine 
soap is prepared from purified medicinal 
soft soap, 300 parts; glycerine free from 
lime, 300 parts; white sugar syrup, 300 
parts; doubly rectified spirit (96 per cent), 
300 parts. The mixture is scented with 
oil of cinnamon, 1 part; oil of sassafras, 
2 parts; oil of citronella, \ part; oil of

formula is given: 

I. — Iodine . 1 av. ounce 

Oleic acid 1 fluidounce 

Alcohol 6 fluidrachma 

Stronger water of 

ammonia 2 fluidrachms 

This makes a soapy paste soluble in all 
liquids, except fixed oils.

monium oleate. 1 fluidounce 
Glycerine to make 20 fiuidouuees 
The solution of ammonium oleate is 
made from oleic acid and spirit of am- 
monia. 

Liquid Soaps. — Liquid soaps, or, as 
they are sometimes called, soap essences, 
are made from pure olive-oil soap by 
dissolving it. in alcohol and adding some 
potassium carbonate. Tallow or lard 
soaps cannot be used, as they will not 
make a transparent preparation. The 
soap is finely shaved and placed with the 
alcohol and potassium carbonate in a 
vessel over a water bath, the temperature 
slowly and gradually raised, while the 
mixture is kept in constant agitation by 
stirring. The soap should be of a pure 
white color and the alcohol gives the best 
product when it is about SO per cent 
strength. After about three-quarters 
of an hour to one hour, solution will ue 
complete and a perfectly transparent 
article obtained. This can be scented 
as desired by adding the proper essen- 
tial oil as soon as the mixture is remcvea 
from the w T ater bath. , j 

If an antiseptic soap is wanted tue 
dition of a small amount of benzoic jMg 
formaldehyde, or corrosive siibiin . 
will give the desired product. W 
soaps should contain from 20 to w 
cent of genuine white castile soap 
about 2 to 24 per cent of potassium 
bonate.

but the soap would likely be rancid or 
not as good.

MEDICATED SOAPS. 

First make up a suitablesoap body and 
afterwards add the medicament. For 
instance, carbolic soaps may be made as 
follows: 

I.— Cocoanut oil 20 pounds 

Tallow 4 pounds 

Soda lye (38° to 40° 

B.) 12 pounds 

Phenol 1 pound 

Prepare the body soap by stirring the 
liquefied fat into the lye at 113° F., and 
when combination has set in, incorpo- 
rate the phenol and quickly pour into 
molds. Cover the latter well. Instead 
of the phenol 2 pounds of sulphur may 
used, and a sulphur soap made.

The oil is mixed in a large bottle with 
water, 100 parts; alcohol, 200 parts; and 
fustic soda, 45 parts, and after saponi- 
^ation the remaining alcohol and the 
{?i as ! l lu L m carbonate dissolved in the 
zV\a , e water * and finally the carbolic 
aci i and the ether are added and the 



whole well shaken. The mixture is 
failed m tightly closed bottles and stored 
at medium temperature. The prepara- 
tion may be scented as desired, and the 
carbolic acid replaced with other anti- 
septics. 

Liquid Tar Soap. — Mix 200 parts of tar 
with 400 parts of oleic acid, warm lightly 
and filter. In this way the aqueous con- 
tent produces no trouble. Now warm 
the filtrate on the water bath, neutralize 
by stirring in an alcoholic potash solution. 
To the soap thus produced, add 100 parts 
of alcohol, and further a little olive oil, in 
order to avoid a separation of any over- 
plus of alkaline matter. Finally, bring up 
to 1,000 parts with glycerine. This soap, 
containing 22 per cent of tar, answers all 
possible demands that may be made upon 
it. Mixed with 2 parts of distilled water 
it leaves no deposit on the walls of the 
container. 

Liquid Styrax Soap.— The process is 
identical with the foregoing. For diges- 
tion with oleic acid, the crude balsai 
will answer, since filtration deprives th' 
product of all contaminating substances. 
While this soap will separate, it is easily 
again rendered homogeneous with a vigor 
ous shake. Preparations made^vith i 
should be accompanied with a "shake 
label. 

Superfatted Liquid Lanolin-Glycerin 
Soap.— Dissolve about 10 per cent o 
lanolin in oleic acid, saponify as m th 
tar soap, and perfume (for which a solu- 
tion of coumarin in geranium oil is pro b 
ably the most suitable agent). 1 he pr 
pared soap is improved by the additio 
of a little tincture of benzoin. 

Massage Soaps.-I .-An excellent red

for bronzing plaster of Paris articles. 
For the same purpose, a mixture is made 
use of consisting of copper soap and iron 
soap melted in white lead varnish and 
wax. Iron soap is used with aluminum 
soap for waterproofing purposes and for 
the production of a waterproof varnish. 
By using wax instead of a soap, insoluble 
metallic soaps are obtained, which, 
melted in oils or wax, impart brilliant 
colorings to them; but colored water- 
proof and weather-resisting varnishes 
may also be produced with them. Me- 
tallic rosin soaps may be produced by 
double decomposition of potash rosin 
soaps and a soluble metal salt. From 
these, good varnishes are obtained to 
render paper carriage covers, etc., water- 
proof; they may also be employed for 
floor wax or lacauers.

SOAP POWDERS. 

The raw materials of which soap pow- 
der is made are soap and soda, to which 
ingredients an addition of talcum or water 
glass can be made, if desired, these ma- 
terials proving very useful as a filling. 
An excellent soap powder has been 
made of 20 parts of crystallized soda, 5 
parts of dark-yellow soap (rosin curd), 
and 1 part of ordinary soft soap. At 
first the two last mentioned are placed in 
a. pan, then half the required quantity 
of soda is added, and the whole is treated. 
Here it must be mentioned that the dark- 
yellow curd soap, which is very rosinous, 
has to be cut in small pieces before 
Placing the quantity into the pan. The 
heating process must continue very 
slowly, and the material has to be 
t^ tc continually until the whole of 
substance has been thoroughly 
Care must be taken that the 
"ng process does not reach the boil- 
ing point. The fire underneath the pan 
must now be extinguished, and then the 
i! m ^!i m ? g half of the crystallized soda 
in j- t0 be cru *ched with the molten 
hi I nts ' until the whole substance 
a Li ; e f, me liquid. The liquefaction is 
assisted by the residual heat of the first 
XonV ™ aterial and the pan. The slow 
UUI ig facilitates the productive pro- 



the 
melted, 
heati 



cess by thickening the mass, and when 
the soda has been absorbed, the whole 
has become fairly thick. With occa- 
sional stirring of the thickened liquid the 
mass is left for a little while longer, 
and when the proper moment has arrived 
the material contained in the pan is 
spread on sheets of thin iron, and these 
are removed to a cool room, where, after 
the first cooling, they must be turned 
over by means of a shovel, and the turn- 
ing process has to be repeated at short 
intervals until the material has quite 
cooled down and the mixture is thor- 
oughly broken. The soap is now in a 
very friable condition, and the time has 
now come to make it into powder, for 
which purpose it is rubbed through the 
wire netting or the perforated sieves. 
Generally the soap is first rubbed 
through a coarse sieve, and then through 
finer ones, until it has reached the re- 
quired conditions of the powder. Some 
of the best soap powders are coarse, but 
other manufacturers making an equally 
good article prefer the finer powder, 
which requires a little more work, since 
it has to go through three sieves, whereas 
the coarse powder .can do with one or at 
most two treatments. But this is, after 
all, a matter of local requirements or per- 
sonal taste. 

The powder obtained from the above- 
mentioned ingiedients is fine and yellow 
colored, and it has all the qualities needed 
for a good sale. Instead of the dark- 
yellow soap, white stock soap can also 
be used, and this makes only a little de- 
ference in the coloring. But again white 
stock soap can be used, and the same 
color obtained by the use of palm oil, or 
other coloring ingredients, as these ma- 
terials are used for giving the toilet 
soaps their manifold different hues. 
Many makers state that tins process is 
too expensive, and not only swallows up 
all the profit, but some of the cdor m- 
terials influence the soap and not to its 

"sSFKp is used only to make the 
powder softer and easier soluble, and or

of the package, and likely a part ot tne 
qulnUty ma| be lost, When the pow- 
Her is too moist or absorbs easily external 
moisture, the paper packages swell very 
easily and burst open. 

The best filling material to be em- 
ployed when it is desired to produce a 
cheaper article is talcum, and m most 
cases this is preferred to water glass. 
The superiority of the former over the 
latter is that water glass hardens the 
powder, and this is sometimes' done to 
such an extent, when a large quantity of 
filling material is needed, that it becomes 
very difficult to rub the soap through the 
sieves. In case this difficulty arises, 
only one thing can be done to lighten the 
task, and that is to powderize the soap 
when the mixed materials are still warm, 
and this facilitates the work very much. 
It is self-evident that friction under these 
conditions leaves a quantity of the soap 
powder material on the sieves, and this 
cannot be lost. Generally it is scraped 
together and returned to the pan to be 
included in the next batch, when it is 
worked up, and so becomes useful, a need 
which does not arise when talcum has 
been used as a filling material. Again, 
the soap powder made with the addition 
of water glass is not so soluble, and at 
the same time much denser than when 
the preparation has been made without 
tins material. It is thus that the purchaser 
receives by equal weight a smaller-looking 
quantity, and as the eye has generally a 
great influence when the consumer deter- 
mines a purchase, the small-sized parcels 
w ill mpress him unfavorably. This second

TOILET SOAPS. , . 

The question as to the

significance. Impurity ot w ^ are

Th every particle of it must be 
a J,icnUv bound up with fatty acid to 
tfKo" a s aft, and the resultant 
n "hould be neutral in reaction. 

SKy of the soa P 3 f °n nd - in c , orame f" 
to day contain free alkali and exert a 
harmful effect upon the skin of those 
who use them. Such soaps may readily 
be detected by bringing them into , con- 
tact with the tongue If free alkali 
be present it will make itself known 
by causing a burning sensation—some- 
thing that a good toilet soap should 

never do. , 

The efficiency of soap depends upon 
the fact that in the presence of an 
abundance of water the saponified tat is 
decomposed into acid and basic salts, in 
which the impurities of the skin are dis- 
solved and are washed away by the 
further application of water. Good soap 
exerts its effects on the outer layer of the 
skin, the so-called horny (epithelial) 
layer, which in soapy water swells up and 
is, in fact, partially dissolved in the 
medium and washed away. This fact, 
however, is unimportant, since the super- 
ficial skin cells are reproduced with 
extraordinary rapidity and ease. When 
a soap contains or carries free alkali, the 
caustic effects of the latter are carried 
further and deeper, reaching below the 
epithelial cells and attacking the true 
skin, in which it causes minute rifts and 
splits and renders it sore and painful. 
Good soap, on the contrary, makes the 
skin smooth and soft. 

Since the employment of poor soaps 
works so injuriously upon the skin, many 
persons never, or rarely ever, use soap, 
but wash the face in water alone, or with 
a "We almond bran added. Their skins 
cannot bear the regular application of 
Poor soap. This, however, applies only to 
Popr, free-alkali containing soaps. Any 
Kin can bear without injury any amount 
i a good toilet soap, free from uncom- 
K? * kali and other impurities. The 
onl °. f , was hing the face with water 

teiljJ"} Ut the use of soa P' must lye 
saraed as one altogether bad, since 



the deposits on the skin, mostly dust- 
particles and dead epithelial cells, ming- 
ling with the oily or greasy matter exuded 
from the fat glands of the skin — ex- 
cellent nutrient media for colonies of 
bacteria — cannot be got rid of by water 
alone. Rubbing only forces the mass 
into the openings in the skin (the sweat 
glands, fat glands, etc.), and stops them 
up. In this way are produced the so- 
called "black heads" and other spots and 
blotches on the skin usually referred to 
by the uneducated, or partially educated, 
as "parasites." The complexion is in 
this manner injured quite as much by 
the failure to use good soap as by the 
use of a poor or bad article. 

All of the skin troubles referred to may 
be totally avoided by the daily use of a 
neutral, alkali-free soap, and the com- 
plexion thus kept fresh and pure. Com- 
pletely neutral soaps, however, are more 
difficult to manufacture — requiring more 
skill and care than those in whnh no 
attention is paid to excess of alkali — ■ 
and consequently cost more than the 
general public are accustomed, or, in 
fact, care to pay for soaps. "While this 
is true, one must not judge the quality 
of a soap by the price demanded for 
it. Some of the manufacturers of mis- 
erable soaps charge the public some of 
the most outrageous prices. JNeither 
can a soap be judged by its odor or 
its style of package and putting on the 
market ^ ^ ^ agreeable odor the 

manufacturers add to it, just when it 
commences to cool off, an etheric oil 
(such as attar of rose, oil of violets, 
berganiot oil, etc.),. or some balsamic 
material (such as tincture of benzoin, 
for instance) . It should be known how- 
ever that while grateful to the olfactory 
nerves these substances do not add one 
par icte to the value of the soap, either

Joft Toilet Soaps. — Soft toilet soaps or 
creams may be prepared from fresh lard 
with a small addition of cocoanut oil and 
caustic potash solution, by the cold 
process or by boiling. For the cold 
process, 23 parts of fresh lard and 2 parts 
of Cochin cocoanut oil are warmed in a 
jacketed pan, and when the temperature 
reaches 113° F. are treated with 9 parts 
of caustic potash and 2} parts of caustic 
soda solution, both of 38° Be. strength, 
the whole being stirred until saponifica- 
tion is complete. The soap is transferred 
to a large marble mortar and pounded 
along with the following scenting ingredi- 
ents: 0.15 parts of oil of bitter almonds and 
0.02 parts of oil of geranium rose, or 0.1 
part of the latter, and 0.05 parts of lemon 
oil. The warm process is preferable, ex- 
perience having shown that boiling is 
essential to the proper saponification of 
tbe fats. In this method, 80 parts of 
lard and 20 parts of Cochin cocoanut oil 
are melted together in a large pan, 100 
parta of potash lye (20° Be.) being then 
crunched in by degrees, and the mass 
raised to boiling point. The combined 
influence of the heat and crutehing 
vapom es part of the water in the lye,

are crutched in gradually. The 
gets thicker and thicker as the water 
expelled and fina 11 y throws up " r " „ 
on the surface, indicating that it i s J~ 
ly finished. At this stage it must K 
crutched vigorously, to prevent scoJ? 
ing against the bottom of the p an an , 
the resulting more or less dark col 0ra 
tion. The evaporation period may £~ 
shortened by using only 50 to 60 parts ot 
lye at first, and fitting with ly e of 25° + 
30° strength. For working on the l ar ° 
scale iron pans heated by steam are 
used, a few makers employing s il ver . 
lined vessels, which have the advantage 
that they are not attacked by the alkali 
Tinned copper pans arc also useful. The 
process takes from 7 to 8 hours, and when 
the soap is finished it is transferred into 
stoneware vessels for storage. Clear 
vegetable oils (castor oil) may he used, 
but the soaps lack the requisite nacreous 
luster required. 

TRANSPARENT SOAPS. 

The mode of production is the same 
for all. The fats are melted together, 
sifted into a double boiler, and the lye is 
stirred in at 111° F. Cover up for an 
hour, steam being allowed to _ enter 
slowly. There is now a clear, grain-like 
soap in the kettle, into which the sugar 
solution and the alcohol are crutched, 
whereupon the kettle is covered up. If 
cuttings are to be used, they are now 
added. When same are melted, tbe 
kettle will contain a thin, clear soap, 
which is colored and scented as m 
directions, and subsequently filled into 
little iron molds and cooled.

Salicylic Soap. — When salicylic acid is 
used in soap it decomposes, as a rule, and 
an alkali salicylate is formed which the 
skin does not absorb. A German chemist 
claims to have overcome this defect by 
thoroughly eliminating all water from 
potash or soda soap, then mixing it with 
vaseline, heating the mixture, and incor- 
porating free salicylic acid with the re- 
sulting mass. The absence of moisture 
prevents any decomposition of the sali- 
cylic acid. 

Olein Soap Substitute, — Fish oil or 
other animal oil is stirred up with sul- 
phuric acid, and then treated with water. 
After another stirring, the whole is left 
to settle, and separate into layers, where- 
upon the acid and water are drawn off, 
and caustic soda solution is stirred in 
with the oil. The finishing stage con- 
sists in stirring in refined mineral oil,

Laundry Soap. — A good, common 
hard soap may be made from clean tal- 
low or lard and caustic soda, without any 
very special skill in manipulation. The 
caustic soda indicated is a crude article 
which may now be obtained from whole- 
sale druggists in quantities to suit, at a 
very moderate price. A lye of average 
strength is made by dissolving it in water 
in the proportion of about 2 pounds to 
the gallon. For the saponification of 
lara, a given quantity of the grease is 
melted at a low heat, and J its weight of 
lye is then added in small portions with 
constant stirring; when incorporation 
has been thoroughly effected, another 
portion of lye equal to the first is added, 
as before, and the mixture kept at a 
gentle heat until saponification appears 
to be complete. If the soap does not 
readily separate from the liquid, more 
lye should be added, the soap being in- 
soluble in strong lye. When separation 



has occurred, pour off the lye, add wrtej 
to tha mass, heat until dissolved, and 



again separate by the use of more strong 
lye or a strong solution of common salt. 
The latter part of the process is designed 
to purify the soap and may be omitted 
where only a cruder article is require". 
The soap is finally remclted on a water 
bath, kept at a gentle heat until as 
water as ^possible is expelled and then 
poured into frames or molds to set-

S0 P J R?SS G 0F METALS AND THE 
REPARATION OF SOLDERS. 

PariwH^, 1 of s °ldering is to unite two 
°ns ot the same metal or of different 



metals by means of a more fusible metal 
or metallic alloy, applied when melted, 
and known by the name of solder. As 
the strength of the soldering depends on 
the nature of the solder used, the degree 
of strength required for the joint must 
be kept in view in choosing a solder. 
The parts to be joined must be free from 
oxide and thoroughly clean; this can be 
secured by filing, scouring, scraping, or 
pickling with acids. The edges must 
fit exactly, and be heated to the melting 
point of the solder. The latter must 
have a lower melting point than either 
of the portions of metal that require to 
be joined, and if possible only those 
metals should be chosen for solder which 
form alloys with thein. The solder 
should also as far as possible have the 
same color and approximately the same 
strength as the article whose edges are to 
be united. 

To remove the layers of oxide which 
form during the process of soldering, 
various so-called "fluxes" are employed. 
These fluxes are melted and applied to 
the joint, and act partly by keeping off 
the air, thus preventing oxidation, and 
partly by reducing and dissolving the 
oxides themselves. The choice of a flux 
depends on the quantity of heat required 
for soldering. d 
Solders are classed as soft and hard 
solders. Soft solders, also called tin 
solders or white solders, consist of soft, 
readily fusible metals or alloys, and do 
not possess much strength; they are easy 
to handle on account of their great 
fusibility. Tin, lead-tin, and alloys i of 
tin, lead, and bismuth are used for soft 
solders, pure tin being employed only for 
articles made of the same metal (pure 

tlD The addition of some lead makes the 
solder less f usible but cheaper, while that 
of bTsmuth lowers the melting point. 
Soft adders are used for soldering easdv
