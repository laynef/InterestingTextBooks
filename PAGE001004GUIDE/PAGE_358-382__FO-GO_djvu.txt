the reddish color, however, was caused 
by the use of too much hydrochloric acid 
this green color does not form. 

Caution* — The corrosive nature of 
hydrochloric acid must not be torgotten. 
must not be allowed to touch the flesh, 
thes, or any metal. 

Detection of Colors. — The detection of 
coloring matter in sausage is often a diffi- 
cult matter without the use of a com- 

Eound microscope. It may sometimes 
e separated, however, by macerating 
the meat with a mixture of eoual parts 
of glycerine and water to which a few 
dropr. of acetic or hydrochloric acid have 
been added. After macerating for some 
time the mixture is filtered and the color- 
ing matter detected by means of dyeing 
wool in the liquid thus obtained. 

Spices. — Although ground spices are 
very frequently adulterated, there are 
few methods that may_ be used by one 
who has not had chemical training, and 
who is not skilled in the use of a com- 
pound microscope, for the detection of 
the adulterants employed. The major- 
ity of the substances used for the adul- 
teration of spices are of a starchy char- 
acter. Unfortunately for our purposes, 
most of the common spices also contain 
a considerable amount of starch. Cloves, 
mustard, and cayenne, however, are prac- 
tically free from starch, and the presence 
of starch m the ground article is proof of 
adulteration. 

Detection of Starch in Cloves, Mustard, 
and Cayenne. — A half teaspoonful of the 
s pi ce in question is stirred into half a 
cupful of boding water, and the boiling 
continued for 2 or 3 minutes. The mix- 
ture is then cooled. If of a dark color, 
it is diluted with a sufficient amount of

the source of the article from ife S* r<Un e

of the residue remaining i r t the , odor 
quite different with different A* iiJ

vinegar has a peculiar fruity odor I 
smal amount of practice with this w 
enables one to distinguish with a kS 
degree of accuracy between wine iS 
cider vinegars and the ordinary fcfljg 

If a sample of vinegar be placed in a 
shallow dish on a warm stove or boiling 
teakettle and heated to a temperature 
sulucient for evaporation and not suffi- 
cient to burn the residue, the odor of the 
warm residue is also characteristic of the 
different kinds of vinegar. Thus, the 
residue from cider vinegar has the 'odor 
of baked apples and the flavor is acid 
and somewhat astringent in taste, and 
that from wine vinegar is equally char- 
acteristic. The residue obtained by 
evaporating vinegar made from sugar- 
house products and from spirit and wood 
vinegar colored by means of caramel 
has the peculiar bitter taste character- 
istic of caramel. 

If the residue be heated until it begins 
to burn, the odor of the burning product 
also varies with different kinds of vine- 
gar. Thus, the residue from cider 
vinegar has the odor of scorched apples, 
while that of vinegars made, from sugar- 
house wastes and of distilled and wood 
vinegars colored with a large amount of 
caramel has the odor of burnt sugar. Ja 
noting these characteristics, however, it 
must be borne in mind that, in order to 
make them conform to these tests, dis- 
tilled and wood vinegars often receive 
the addition of apple jellv. 

The cheaper forms of vinegar, espe- 
cially distilled and wood vinegar, are 
commonly colored with caramel, wnic 
can be detected by the method given-

m. 

Many other methods of preservation 
ave been tried with variable degrees of 
success; and of the more thoroughly 
tested . ones the following probably 
include all of those deserving more than 
passing mention or consideration. 

1. The exclusion of external, atmos- 
pheric electricity, which has been ob- 
served to materially reduce the decaying 
of meat, milk, butter, beer, etc. 

2. The retention of occluded electric 
currents. Meats from various animals 
packed into the same packages, and sur- 
rounded by a conducting medium, such 
as salt and water, liberate electricity, 

3. The removal of the nerve centers. 
Carcasses with the brains and spinal cord 
left therein will be found more prone 
to decomposition than those wherefrom 
these organs have been removed. 

4. Desiccation. Dried beef is an 
excellent example of this method of pres- 
ervation. Other methods coming un- 
der this heading are the application of 
spices with ethereal oils, various herbs, 
coriander seed extracted with vinegar, 
etc. 

5. Reduction of 
cold storage. 

6. Expulsion of air from the meat and 
the containers. Appert's, Willaumez's, 
Redwood's, and Prof. A. Vogel's meth- 
ods are representative for this category of 
preservation. Phenyl paper, Dr. Busch's 
Georges's, and Medloek and Eaily's proc- 
esses are equally well known. 

7. The application of gases. Here 
may be mentioned Dr. Gamgee's and 
Bert and Reynoso's processes, applying 
carbon dioxide and other compressed 
gases, respectively. 

j Air-drying, powdering of meat, smok- 
ing, pickling, sugar or vinegar curine 
are too well known to receive any 
further attention here. Whatever proc- 
ess may be employed, preference should 
be given to that which will secure the 
rmcipal objects sought for, the most 
satisfactory being at the same time not 
deleterious to health, and of an easily 
applicable and inexpensive nature.

Extract of Meat Containing Albume 

— In the ordinary production of meat 
extract, the albumen is more or less lost, 
partly through precipitation by the acids 
or the acid salts of the meat extract, part- 
ly through salting out by the salts of the ex- 
tract, and partly by coagulation at a higher 
temperature. A subsequent addition of 
albumen is impracticable because the al- 
bumen is likewise precipitated, msolubly, 
by the acids and salts contained m the 
extract. This precipitation can be pre- 
vented, according to a French paxent. by 
neutralizing the extract before mixing 
with albumen, by the aid of sod urn 
bicarbonate. The drying of the mixture 
is accomplished in a carbonic acid at 
mo S phere P The preparation d^bes

When once oxidation starts, the heat gen-

cally automatically. 

Determination of the Presence of For- 
maldehyde in Solutions.— Lemme makes 
use, for this purpose, of the fact that 
formaldehyde, in neutral solutions of 
sodium sulphite, forms normal bisulphite 
salts, setting free a corresponding quan- 
tity of sodium hydrate, that may be 
titrated with sulphuric acid and phenol- 
phthalcin. The sodium sulphite solu- 
tion has an alkaline reaction toward 
phenolphthalein, and must be exactly 
neutralized with sodium bisulphite. 
Then to 100 cubic centimeters of this 
solution of 250 grams of sodium sulphite 
(Na;iS0 3 +7H a O) in 750 grams water, 
add 5 cubic centimeters of the suspected 
formaldehyde solution. A strong red 
color is instantlv produced. Titrate wp 
normal sulphuric acid until the color 
disappears. As the exact disappearance 
of the color is not easily determined, a 
margin of from 0.1 to 0.2 cubic centi- 
meters may be allowed without the ex- 
actness of the reaction being injured, 
since 1 cubic centimeter of normal acid 
answers to only 0.03 grams of formal- 
dehyde.

Liquid for Cooling Automobile En- 
gines.— In order to prevent freezing of the 
Jacket water, when the engine is not m 
operation in eold weather, solutions are 
used, notably of glycerine and of calcium 
chloride (CaClO- The proportions for 
the former solution are equal parts ot 
water and glycerine, by weight; for the 
latter, approximately h gallon of water to 
8 pounds of CaCU, or a saturated solution 
at60°F. This solution (CaCJ 2 +6Ji 5 Uj 
is then mixed with equal parts of water, 
gallon for gallon. Many persons com- 
plain that CaCl a corrodes the metal parts, 
but this warning need do no more than 
urge the automobilist to use only the 
chemically pure salt, carefully avoiding 
the "chloride of lime" (CaOClj). . 

A practical manufacturing chemist of 
wide experience gives this: 

A saturated solution oE common salt is 
one of the best things to use. It does 
not affect the metal of the engine, as 
many other salts would, and is easily 
renewed. It will remain fluid down to 
0° F., or a little below. 

Equal parts of glycerine and water is 
also good, and has the advantage that it 
will not crystallize in the chambers, or 
evaporate readily. It is the most con- 
venient solution to use on this account, 
and may repay the increased cost over 
brine, in the comfort of its use. It ueeds 
only the occasional addition of a nttie 
water to make it last all winter ana 
eave the machinery clean when it is 



drawn off. With brine an incrustation

L ~9 rus . hed Strawberry.— p,,t up bv 
the following process, the fruit retains 
its natural color and taste, and may be 
exposed to the air for months, without 
fermenting: 

Take fresh, ripe berries, stem them, 
and rub through a No. 8 sieve, rejecting 
all soft and green fruit. Add to each 
gallon of pulp thus obtained, 8 pounds of 
granulated sugar. Put on the fire and 
bring just to a boil, stirring constantly. 
Just before removing from the fire, add 
to each gallon 1 ounce of a saturated 
alcoholic solution of salicylic acid, stir* 
ring well. Remove the scum, and, while 
still hot, put into jars, and hermetically 
seal. Put the jars in cold water, ana 
raise them to the boiling point, to pre- 
vent them from bursting by sudden 
expansion on pouring hot fruit into 
them. Fill the jars entirely full, so as to 
leave no air space when fruit cools and 
contracts. 

II. — Crushed Raspberry.— Prepare in 
the same manner as for crushed straw- 
berry, using J red raspberries and | 
black, to give a nice color, and using " 
pounds of sugar to each gallon of pulp- 

III. — Crushed Pineapple.— Secure a 
good brand of canned grated pineapple, 
and drain off about one-half of the liquor, 
by placing on a strainer. Add fo e«j

Powdered charcoal. 7 ounces 
Oil of eucalyptus.. . 25 drops 

Oil of cloves 25 drops 

Water, a sufficiency. 
Make a smooth paste, press into molds 
and dry. 

FURS: 

To Clean Furs. —For dark furs, warm 
a quantity of new bran in a pan, taking 
care Unit it does not burn, to prevent 
which it must be briskly stirred. When 
well warmed rub it thoroughly into the 
fur with the hand. Repeat this 2 or 3 
times, then shake the fur, and give it 
another sharp rubbing until free from 
dust. For white furs: Lay them on a 
table, and rub well with bran made 
moist with warm water; rub until quite 
dry, and afterwards with dry bran. The 
wet bran should be put on with flannel, 
then dry with book muslin. Light furs, 
in addition to the above, should be well 
rubbed with magnesia or a piece of book 
muslin, after the bran process, against 
the way of the fur. 

To Preserve Furs. I, — Furs may be 
preserved from moths and other insects 
by placing a little colocynth pulp (bitter 
apple), or spice (cloves, pimento, etc.), 
wrapped in muslin, among them; or they 
may be washed in a very weak solution 
of eorrosLve sublimate in warm water 
(10 to 15 grains to the pint), and after- 
wards carefully dried. As well as every 
other species of clothing, they should be 
kept m a clean, dry place, from which 
tney should be taken out occasionally 
well beaten, exposed to the air, and re- 
turned. 

II.— Sprinkle the furs or woolen 
stuas, as well as the drawers or boxes in 
wnicn they are kept, with spirits of tur- 
pentine, the unpleasant scent of which 
will speedily evaporate on exposure of 
the stuffs to the air. Some persons 
place sheets of paper moistened with 
spirits of turpentine, over, under, or 
between pieces of cloth, etc., and find it 
a very effectual method. Manv woolen 
drapers put bits of camphor, th"e size of 

nt uarts 

of the shelves in their shops, and as they 
brush their cloths every 2, 3, or 4 
months, this keeps them free from moths; 
and this should be done in boxes where 
tfce turs. etc., are put. A tallow candle is 
requently put within each muff when 
lain by. bnuff or pepper is also good.

together 75 parts of wet fireclay, 3 patg 
of black oxide manganese, 3 parts of 
white sand, and 1 part of powdered as-

enough water to make a smooth paste 
Apply this paste over the cracks and 
when dry it will be as hard as iron and

FURNITURE FOR GARDENS: 

To make imitation stone for outdoor 
furniture sundials, flower pots, etc., use: 
10 parts lime ; 12 parts rosin ; I part lin- 
seed oil. Dissolve ingredients thoroughly 
and apply the mixture while hot to the 
wood as a coating. The result will be 
attractive stone-like appearance that will

water, add a few drops of nitric acid, and 
then suspend the zinc rod in the solution. 
The lead is precipitated in large and 
■ beautiful plates until the solution is ex- 
hausted or the zinc dissolved. _ In this 
case the action is electro-chemical, the 
fiTst portions of the lead precipitated 
forming with the zinc a voltaic arrange- 
ment of sufficient power to decompose 
the salt. 

It is said that by substituting chloride 
of tin for the lead salt a"tin tree" may be 
produced, while nitrate of silver under 
the same conditions would produce a 
"silver tree." In the latter case dis- 
tilled water should be used to. prevent 
precipitation of the silver_ by possible 
impurities contained in ordinary water.

GELATIN: 

French Gelatin.— Gelatin is derive 
from two sources, the parings of skins 
hides, etc., and from bones. The latte 
are submitted to the action of dilut 
hydrochloric acL for several days, whie 
attacks the inorganic matters — car 
bonates, phosphates, etc., and leaves th 
ossein, which is, so to say, an isomer 01 
the skin substance. The skin, parings 
of hide, etc., gathered from the shambles, 
butcher shops, etc., arc brought into the 
factory, and if not ready for immediate 
use are thrown into quicklime, which 
preserves them for the time being. From 
the lime, after washing, they pass into 
dilute acid, which removes the last traces 
of lime, and arc now ready for the treat- 
ment that is to furnish the pure gelatin. 
The ossein from bones goes through the 
same stages of treatment, into lime, washed 
and laid in dilute acid again. From the 
acid bath the material goes into baths ot 
water maintained at a temperature not 
higher than from 175° to 195 F-

To Clarify Solutions of Gelatin, Glues, 
etc. — If 1 per cent of ammonium fluoride 
be added to turbid solutions of gelatin or 
common glue, or, in fact, of any gums, 
it quickly clarifies them. It causes a dep- 
osition of ligneous matter, and also very 
materially increases the adhesive power 
of such solutions. 

Air Bubbles in Gelatin. — The pres- 
ence of minute air bubbles in cakes of 
commercial gelatin often imparts to 
ihem an unpleasant cloudy appearance. 
These minute air bubbles are the result 
of the rapid, continuous process of drying 
the sheets of gelatin Dj a counter-cur- 
rent of hot air. Owing to the rapid 
drying a hard shin is formed on the out- 
side of the cake, leaving a central layer 
from which the moisture escapes only 
•with' difficulty, and in which the air bub- 
bles remain behind. Since the best qual- 
ities of gelatin dry most rapidly, the 
presence of these minute bubbles is, to a 
certain extent, an indication of supe- 
riority, and they rarely occur in the poorer 

aualities of gelatin. If dried slowly in 
le old way gelatin is liable to be dam- 
aged by fermentation ; in such cases large 
bubbles of gas are formed in the sheets, 
and are a sign of bad quality. 

GEMS, ARTIFICIAL: 

See also Diamonds. 
The raw materials for the production 
of artificial gems are the finest silica and, 
as a rule, finely ground rock crystals; 
white sand and quartz, which remain 
pure white even at a higher temperature, 
may also be used. 

< Artificial borax is given the preference, 
since the native variety frequently con- 
tains substances which color the glass. 
Lead carbonate or red lead must be per- 
fectly pure and not contain any protoxide, 
since the latter gives the glass a dull' 
greenish hue. White lead and red lead 
nave to dissolve completely in dilute nitric 
acid or without leaving a residue; the so- 
lution, neutralized as much as possible, 
must not be reddened by prussiate of pot- 
*i? i tiie former case t:n is present, in 
tne latter copper. Arsenious acid and salt- 
peter must be perfectly pure; they serve 
ior the destruction of the organic sub- 
stances. ^ The materials, without the col- 
oring oxide, furnish the starting quantity 
for the production of artificial gems; such 
glass pastes are named "strass."

GLASS GRINDING FLUID:

Moisten the glass with the fluid and 
ad d powdered emery as needed. 

Uent Glass.-This was formerly used 
I r Pnspa - its use m store fronts is 
t& »o« and more familiar, large 
Xs being bent for this purpose. It is 
K uch used in the construction of dwell- 
in windows, or rounded corners, 
Sffii towers; in coach fronts and m 
rounded front china closets Either plain 
g££ «■ beveled glass may be bent, and to 

an The r numr.er of molds required in a 
glass-bending establishment is large. 

The bending is done in a kiln. Wass 
melts at 2,300° F,; the heat employed in 
bending is 1,S0G°F. No pyrometer would 
stand long in that heat, so the beat of 
the kiln is judged from the color of the 
flame and other indications, bmaller 
pieces of glass are put into the molds in 
the kilns with forks made for the purpose. 
The great molds used for bending large 
sheets of glass are mounted on cars, that 
may be rolled in and out of kilns. 1 he 
glass is laid upon the top of the mold or 
cavity, and is bent by its own weight. 
As it is softened by the heat it sinks into 
the mold and so is bent. It may take 
an hour or two to bend the glass, which 
is then left in the kiln from 24 to 36 hours 
to anneal and cool. Glass of any kind 
or size is put into the kilns in its finished 
state; the great heat to which it is sub- 
jected does not disturb the polished sur- 
face. Despite every precaution more 
ot less glass is broken in bending. Bent 
glass costs about 50 per cent more than 
tho flat. 

The use of bent glass is increasing, 
and there are 4 or 5 glass-bending estab- 
lishments in the United States, of which 
one is in the East. 

Colored Glass. — R. Zsigmondy has 
taade some interesting experiments m 
coloring glass with metallic sulphides, 
such as molybdenite, and sulphides or 
antimony, copper, bismuth, and nickel, 
■bests made with batches of 20 to 40 
Pounds and with a heat not too great, give 
good results as follows: 

Sand, 65 parts; potash, 15 parts; soda, 



5 parts; lime, 0 parts; molybdenite, S 
parte ; sulphide of sodium, 2 parts, 
(lark reddish-brown glass. In t 
layers this glass appeared light bra Wh 
yellow. Flashed with opal, it became a 
smutty black brown. 

Sand 50 parts; potash, 15 parts; soda, 
5 parts; lime, 9 parts; molybdenite, 1 part 
sulphide of sodium, 2 parts, gave a yello 
glass. 

Sand, lOparts; potash, 3.3 parts; sod 
0.27 parts; lime, 1.64 parts; molybdeni 
0.03 parts, gave a reddish-yellow 
with a fine tinge of red. 

Sand, 100 parts; potash, 26 parts; sod 
108 parts; lime, 12 parts; sulphide of cop- 
per, 1.7 parts; sulphide of sodium, 2.8 
parts, gave a dark-brown color, varying 
from sepia to sienna, In thick layers it 
was no longer transparent, but still clear 
and unclouded. When heated this glass 
became smutty black brown and clouded. 

A fine copper red was obtained from 
sand, 10 parts; potash, 3 parts; lime, 1.8 
parts; soda, 0.25 parts; sulphide of cop- 
per, 7.5 parts; sulphide of sodium, 10.5 
parts; borax, 9.5 parts. 

Attempts to color with sulphides of 
antimony and bismuth failed. But the 
addition of 7 per cent of sulphide of 
nickel to an ordinary batch gave a glass 
of fine amethyst color. 

Coloring Electric-Light Bulbs and 
Globes.— Two substances suggest them- 
selves as excellent vehicles of color, and 
both water soluble— water glass (po- 
tassium or yodium silicate) and gelatin. 
For Sting, water-solub e 
should be tried. The thickness _ of the

common string in alcohol and squeeze 
it reasonably dry. Then tie the string 
tightly around the glass on the line of 
cutting. t Touch a match to the string 
and let it burn off. The heat of the 
burning string will weaken the glass in 
this particular place. While it is hot 
plunge the glass under water, Jetting the 
arm go well under to the elbow, so there 
will be no vibration when the glass is 
struck. With the free hand strike the 
glass outside the line of cutting, giving a 
quick, sharp stroke with a stick of wood, 
a long-bladed knife, or the like, and the 
cut will be as clean and straight as if 
made by a regular glass cutter. 

The same principle may be employed 
to cut bottles into vases, and to form all 
sorts of pretty things, such as jewelry 
boxes, picture panes, trays, small tablets, 
windows for a doll house, etc. 

II. — Scratch the glass around the 
shape you desire with the corner of a file 
or graver; then, having bent a piece of 
wire into the same shape, heat it red hot 
and lay it upon the scratch and sink the 
glass into cold water just deep enough 
for the water to come almost on a level 
with its upper surface. It will rarely 
fail to break perfectly true. 

To Cut Glass Under Water.— It is 
possible to cut a sheet of glass roughly 
to any desired shape with an ordinary 
pair of scissors, if the operation be per- 
formed under water. Of course, a 
smooth edge cannot be obtained by such 
means, but it will be found satisfactory. 

Drilling, Shaping, and Filing Glass.— 
lake any good piece of steel wire, 
hie to the shape of a drill, and then hold 
it m a flame till it is at a dull red heat; 
then quench in metallic mercury. A 
piece of good steel, thus treated, will bore 
through glass almost as easily as through 
soft brass. In use, lubricate with oil of 
turpentine in which camphor has been 
dissolved. When the point of the drill 
has touched the other side put the glass 
m water, and proceed with the drilling 
very slowly. If not possible to do this", 
reverse the work— turn the glass over 
and drill, very carefully, from the op- 
posite side. By proceeding with care 
you can easily drill three holes through 
glass Vfe inch thick ^ of an inch apart 
In making the drill be careful not to make 
the point and the cutting edges too acute, 
l he drill cuts more slowly, but more safe- 
ly, when the point and cutting edges are 
at a low angle. 

To Make Holes in Thin Glass.— To 
produce holes in panes of thin or weak 



glass, provide the places to be p er f ora 
with a ring of moist loam, whose S 
leaves free a portion of c] aS a ..Ir -

To Grind Glass.— For the gri n dir, w * 
glass, iron, or steel laps and £2 ? °f 
are first used; after that, the sand £** 
placed by emery. Then the polk?/ 
is started with pure lead or pure tin 1 8

Pohl asserts that if glass is polish^ 
with crocus (Paris red) it appears of 1 
dark or a yellowish-brown tint. He con 
tends that the crocus enters the pores of 
the glass, and, to prevent this, he uses 
zinc white with the most satisfactory 
results. 1 

A Home -Made Outfit for Grinding 
Glass. — Provide two pieces of cork, one 
concave and one convex (which may be 
cut to shape after fitting to the lathe). 
Take a copper cent or other suitable 
article and soft-solder a screw to fit the 
lathe, and then wax it to the cork; get a 
cheap emery wheel, such as is used on 
sewing machines. Polish the edge on 
thezinc collar of the emery wheel (or use 
a piece of zinc). The other cork should 
be waxed to a penny and centered. 
Spectacle lenses may be cut on the same 
emery wheel if the wheel is attached to 
the lathe so as to revolve. Another 
method is to take a common piece of 
window glass (green glass is the best) 
and make a grindstone of that, using the 
flat surface for grinding. Cement it on 
a large chuck, the glass being from 2 to 
2} inches in diameter. 

To Drill Optical Glass. — A graver 
sharpened to a long point is twisted 
between the fingers, and pressed against 
the glass, the point being moistened 
from time to time with turpentine. 
When the hole is finished half way, the 
drilling should be commenced from the 
other side. The starting should be be- 
gun with care, as otherwise the graver 
is likely to slide out and scratch the lens. 
It is advisable to mark the point of drill- 
ing with a diamond, and not to appiy 
too great a pressure when twisting « e 
graver.

cially good work be required, a second 
layer of gold is put on and covered as 
before. In this ease, however, the gela- 
tin is used hot. After the gilding has 
become perfectly dry the letters or orna-

The best backing for glass gilding is 
asphaHurn, with a little lampblack, tins 
to be mixed up with elastic varnish; 
outside finishing varnish is the best, as 
the addition of this material gives dur- 
ability.

The blue tint of the common poison 
bottle is got by the addition of black 
oxide of cobalt to the molten glass; the 
green tint of the actinic glass bottle is 
obtained in the same way by the ad-

is reduced to the basylous condition, and 
the amber tint is produced by the ad-

of iron, are extremely difficult to keep 
■water-tight, as the iron expands and 
contracts with atmospheric changes. 
To nieet this evil, it is necessary to use 
an elastic putty, which follows the vari- 
ations of the iron. A good formula is: 
Two parts rosin and one part tallow, 
melted together and stirred together 
thoroughly with a little minium. This 
putty is applied hot upon strips of linen 
r cotton cloth, on top and below, and 
these are pasted while the putty is still 
warm, with one edge on the iron ribs and 
the other, about one-fourth inch broad, 
over the glass. 

Tightening Agent for Acid Receptacles. 
■ — Cracked vessels of glass or porcelain, 
or use in keeping acids, can be made 
ight by applying a cement prepared in 
e following manner: Take finely sifted 
and, some asbestos with short fiber, a 
ttle magnesia and add enough con- 
entrated water glass to obtain a readily 
kneadable mass. The acid renders the 
putty firm and waterproof,

|bis is an excellent imitation of ground 



By using colored glass, a pattern in 
half-tint may be made on tL colored 
ground and after decorating white glass, 
the back may be silvered or gilded. 

Engraving, Matting, and Frosting.— 
Cover the glass with a layer of wax or of 
varnish on which the designs are traced 
with a graver or pen-point; next, hydro- 
fluoric acid is poured on the tracings. 
This acid is very dangerous to handle, 
while the following process, though fur-

VII —Take white lead ground in a mix- 
ture of I varnish and \ oil of turpentine, 
to which burnt white vitriol and white 
sugar of lead are added for drier. The 
paint must be prepared exceedingly thin 
and applied to the glass evenly, using 
a broad brush. If the windows require 
a new coat, the old one is nrst removed 
by the use of a strong lye, or else apply 
a mixture of hydrochloric acid, 2 parts; 
vitriol, 2 parts; copper sulphate, 1 part'» 
and gum arabic 1 part, by means of a 
brush. The production of this imitation 
frosting entails little expense and is of 
special advantage when a temporary use 
of the glass is desired. 

VIII.— A little Epsom salt (sulphate of 
magnesia) stirred in beer with a small 
dose of dextrin and applied on the panes 
by means of a sponge or a brush permits 
of obtaining mat panes. 

Hoarfrost Glass.— The feathery foams 
traced by frost on the inside of the 
windows in cold weather may be imitated 
as Follows: 

The surface is first ground either by 
sand-blast or the ordinary method, and 
is then covered with a sort of varnish. 
On being dried either in the sun or by 
artificial heat, the varnish contracts 
strongly, taking with it the particles of 
glass to which it adheres; and as the con- 
traction takes places along definite lines, 
the pattern given by the removal of the 
particles of glass resembles very closely 
the branching crystals of frostwork. A 



„^ t „ „^ i™ u ,Mag process, though fur- 
nishing the same results, does not present 
this drawback: Take powdered fluoride 
of lime, 1 part, and sulphuric acid, 2 parts. 
Make a homogeneous paste, which is 
spread on the parts reserved for the 
engraving or frosting. At the end of 
S or 4 hours wash with water to remove 
the acid, next with alcohol to take off 
the varnish, or with essence of turpen- 
tine if wax has been employed for stop- 
ping off. 

To Render Window Panes Opaque.— 
I. — Panes may be rendered mat and 
non-transparent by painting them on one 
side with a liquid prepared by grinding 
whiting with potash water-glass solution. 
After one or two applications, the panes 
are perfectly opaque, while admitting the 
light. 

II.— Paint the panes with a solution of

when the glass is liable to be damp, for 
in that case the effect will be a blurred 
one. When it is desirable to remove 
the coating, lukewarm water will serve 
the purpose without damage to the 
luster of the mirror. 

II. — The following mixture, when 
applied to a mirror and left to dry, will 
form in many shapes, all radiating from 
a focus, this focus forming anywhere on 
the glass, and when all dry tends to form 
a most pleasing object to the eye. 

Sour ale 4 ounces 

Magnesium sulphate. 1 ounce 
Put on the mirror with a small, clean 
sponge and let dry. It is now ready 
for the artist, and he may choose his own 
colors and subject. 

Crystalline Coatings or Frostwork on 
Glass or Paper. — Dissolve a small quan- 
tity of dextrin (gum arabic and trag- 
acanth are not so suitable) in aqueous 
salt solution as concentrated as possible, 
for instance, in sulphate of magnesia 
(bitter salt), sulphate of zinc or any 
other readily crystallizing salt; filter the 
solution through white blotting paper 
and coat glass panes uniformly thin with 
the clear filtrate, using a fine, broad 
badger brush; leave them lying at an 
ordinary medium temperature about one- 
quarter hour in a horizontal position. 

As the water slowly evaporates during 
this short time, handsome crystalline 
patterns, closely resembling frostwork, 
will develop gradually on the glass panes, 
which adhere so firmly to the glass or the 
paper (if well-sized glazed paper had 
been used) that they will not rub off 
easily. They can be permanently fixed 
by a subsequent coat of alcoholic shellac 
solution. 

Especially handsome effects are pro- 
duced with colored glass panes thus 
treated, and m the case of reflected light 
by colored paper. 

For testing crystals as regards their 
optical behavior, among others their 
behavior to polarized light, it is sufficient 
r i pl t\ 1T a solutio11 of collodion wool 
(soluble peroxide lime for the prepara- 
tion of collodion) over the surface of 
glass with the crystalline designs, and to 
P n , e dr y collodion fil m care- 
jW- , If thls ls done cautiously it is not 
difficult to lift the whole crystalline 
group from the glass plate and to in- 
corporate it with the glass-like, thin 
collodion film. 

REMOVING WINDOW FROST.

it is claimed, not only prevents the 
formation of frost, but also 
sweating.

To Prevent Dimming of Eyeglasses, 
etc.— Mix olein-potash soap with about 
3 per cent of glycerine and a little oil 
turpentine. Similar mixtures have also 
been recommended for polishing physi- 
cians' reflectors, show-windows, etc., to 
prevent dimming. 

WRITING ON GLASS: 

See also Etching and Inks. 

Composition for Writing on Glass,— 
To obtain mat designs on glass, take 
sodium fluoride, 35 parts; potassium sul- 
phate, 7 parts; zinc chloride, 15 parts: 
hydrochloric acid, 65 parts; distilled 
water, 1,000 parts. Dissolve the sodium 
fluoride and the potassium sulphate in 
half the water; dissolve the zinc chloride 
in the remaining water and add the 
hydrochloric acid. Preserve these two 
solutions separately. For use, mix a 
little of each solution and write on 
glass with a pen or brush.

Acetone is very inflammable, so keep it 
away from open flame and sparks of any 
kind Set iar in a cool place and shake 
ft frequently for about 24 hours, after 
which the celluloid should be dissolved. 
The mixture when complete, should be 
about the consistency of ordinary mixed 
mint If it is too thick, add more ace- 
tone It may be colored, if desired, by 
adding a little aniline dye and blending 
thoroughly. 

To apply the coating use ordinary un- 
painted wire window screening. # 

Do work if possible in the open air to 
allow fumes to escape. Pour solution in 
a trough, wood or metal, long enough to 
accommodate width of screen, run screen 
through solution slowly, holding the 
screen that has been immersed upright 
so it will drain off surplus solution back 
into tank. If the solution is of proper 
consistency work will turn out perfectly. 

When mixture starts to dry it appears 
dirty and greasy, but after it is thor- 
oughly dry the surface will clear up and 
each square will he filled with a thin cel- 
luloid film. After it is dry the Duro- 
Glass may be cut, rolled and tacked m 
place, the same as before the screen was 
treated. It is used for sun parlors, sum- 
taer camps, sleeping porches, barns, poul- 
try houses, greenhouses, etc.

Glazing on Size Colors. — The essentia 
condition for this work is a well-size 
foundation. For the glazing paint, siz 
is likewise used as a binder, but a little 
dissolved soap is added, of about the 
strength employed for coating ceilings. 
Good veining can be done with this, and 
a better effect can be produced in execut- 
ing pieces which are to appear in relief, 
such as car-touches, masks, knobs, etc., 
than with the ordinary means. A skill- 
ful grainer may also impart to the work 
the pleasant luster of natural -wood. 
The same glazing method is applicable 
to colored paintings. If the glazing 
colors are prepared with wax, dissolved 
in French turpentine, one may likewise 
elaze with them on a size-paint ground 
Glazing tube-oil colors thinned with 
turpentine and siccative, are also useful 
this purpose. For the shadows,

Glue 

(Formulas for Glues and methods of 
manufacturing Glue will be found under 
Adhesives.) 

GLUE, TO PREVENT FROM 
CRUSTING IN GLUE POTS: 

Clean glue pot thoroughly and then 
wipe entire inside of glue pot with a 
handful of waste previously soaked in 
any light mineral oil. As oil and glue 
will not mix the film of oil on the sides 
of the glue pot keeps the glue from stick- 
ing to and "crusting up." 

Rendering Glue Insoluble in Water — 
Stuebling finds that the usual mixture of 
bichromate and glue when used in the 
ordinary way does not possess the water- 
proof properties with which it is gener 
ally credited. If mixed in the daylight 
it sets hard before it can be applied to 
the surfaces to be glued, and if mixed 
and applied in the dark room it remains 
lust as soluble as ordinary glue, the 
light being unable to penetrate the in- 
tenor of the joints. Neither is a mixture 
of linseed oil and glue of any use for this 
purpose. Happening to upset a strong 
solution of alnm^prepared for wood 
staining— mto an adjacent glue pot, he 
stirred up the two together out of 
curiosity and left them. Wishing to use 
the gl U e a few dayg fae tried fQ

™eceg of wood, these resisting the action 
oi the water completely.

The viscous matter is washed, then 
dissolved in hot water, and allowed to 
cool, a quantity of weak alcohol acid 
ulated by 1 per cent of hydrochloric acid 
being added just before the mass solidi- 
fies. From g to 3 parts, by volume, of 
strong alcohol (methyl or ethyl) are 
then added and the solution filtered, 
charcoal being used if necessary. The 
glue is finally precipitated from this 
solution by neutralizing with ammonia 
and washing with alcohol or water. 

To Distinguish Glue and Other Ad- 
hesive Agents. — The product to be ex- 
amined is heated with hydrofluoric acid 
(50 per cent). If bone glue is present in 
any reasonable quantity, an intense odor 
of butyric acid arises at once, similar 
to that of Lirnburger cheese. But if 
dextrin or gum arable is present, only 
an odor of dextrine or fluorhydric acid 
will be perceptible. Conduct the re- 
action with small quantities; otherwise 
the smell will be so strong that it is hard 
to remove from the room.

once. If the warm plate remains too 
long on the oilcloth, the gold leaf will 
stick. When the impression is done, the 
gold leaf is not swept off at once, but 
the oilcloth is first allowed to cool com- 
pletely for several minutes, since there 
is a possibility that it has become slightly 
softened under the influence of the heat, 
especially at the borders of the pressed 
figures, and the gold would stick there 
if swept oil immediately. The printing 
should be sharp and neat and the gold 
glossy. For bronze printing on oilcloth, 
a preliminary treatment of printing with 
varnish ground should be given. The 
bronze is dusted on this varnish. 

Imitation leather is generally treated 
in the same manner. The tough paper 
substance is made to imitate leather 
perfectly as regards color and press- 
ing, especially tnn various sorts of calf, 
but the treatment in press gilding differs 
entirely from that of genuine leather. 
The stuff does not possess the porous, 
spongy nature of leather, but on the 
contrary is very hard, and in the 
course of manufacture in stained-paper 
factories is given an almost waterproof 
coating of color and varnish. Hence 
the applied ground of white of egg pene- 
trates but slightly into this substance, 
and a thm layer of white of egg remains 
on the surface. The consequence is 
that m gilding the gold leaf is prone to 
become attached, the ground of albumen 
being quickly dissolved under the action 
of the heat and put in a soft sticky state 
even m places where there is no en- 
graving^ In order to avoid this the 
ground is either printed only lukewarm, 
or this imitation leather is not primed at 
all, but the gold is applied immediately 
upon going over the surface with the oily 
rag. Print with a rather hot press, with

cool until it reaches 45° F., then test it 
with the hydrometer, and if specific 
gravity is not 995 continue the addition of 
turpentine and warming until correct, 
let it thoroughly cool, then bottle, keep- 
ing it air-tight.

Gradually subside; wash it with cold 
water and dry in an evaporating dish. 

All rags and settlings that arc thick 
should be burnt in a crucible until a 
vellow mass is seen; then take this and 
dissolve i t i n % parts muriatic acid and 1 
nart nitric acid. Let it remain in a porce- 
lain dish until it begins to thicken and 
rrvstals form on the sides. Add a little 
nitric acid, and heat until crystals again 
form Now take this and mix with cold 
water add a solution of copperas to it 
and allow it to settle; pour off the water, 
"d with fresh water wash till quite free 
from acid. The gold may then be used 
again, and if great care is exercised 
almost one-half the original quantity 
may be recovered. . 

The quantities given in the recipe 
should produce about 13 to 15 parts of 
the liquid gold. It does not in use require 
anv burnishing, and should be fired at rose- 
color heat. If desired it can be fluxed 
with Venice turpentine, oil of lavender, 
or almonds. 

i Treatment of Brittle Gold, — I. Add 
to every 100 parts, by weight, 5 to 8 parts, 
by weight, of cupric chloride and melt un- 
til the oily layer which forms has disap- 
peared. Then pour out, and in most 
cases a perfectly pliable gold will have 
been obtained. If this should not be the 
case after the first fusion, repeat the oper- 
ation with the same quantity of cupric 
chloride. The cupric chloride must be 
kept in a well-closed bottle, made tight 
with parafune, and in a dry place.

molten gold, by which treatment most of 
the gold which has otherwise been set 
aside as unfit for certain kinds of work 
may be redeemed. 

Assaying of Gold.— To determine the 
presence of gold in ores, etc., mix a 
small quantity of the finely powdered 
ore in a flask with an equal volume of 
tincture of iodine, shake repeatedly and 
well, and leave in contact about 1 hour, 
with repeated shaking. Next allow the 
mixture to deposit and dip a narrow 
strip of filtering paper into the solution. 
Allow the paper to absorb, next to dry; 
then dip it again into the solution, re- 
peating this 5 to 6 times, so that the 
filtering paper is well saturated and im- 
pregnated. The strip is now calcined, 
as it were, and the ashes, if gold is 
present, show a purple color. The 
coloring disappears immediately if the 
ashes are moistened with bromine water. 
The same test may also be modified 
as follows: Cover the finely pulverized 



ore with bromine water, shake well and 
repeatedly during about 1 hour of the 
contact, and filter. Now add to the 
solution stannic protochloride in solution, 
whereby, in case gold is present, a purple 
color (gold purple of Cassius) will at 
once appear. In case the ore to be 
assayed contains sulphides, it is well to 
roast the ore previously, and should it 
contain lime carbonate, it is advisable to 
calcine the ore before in the presence of 
ammonium carbonate. 



Gold Welding. — Gold may be welde 
together with any metal, if the rigl 
methods are employed, but best wit 
copper. Some recipes for welding ageh 
are here given. 

I. — Two parts by weight (16 ounc 
equal 1 pound) of green vitriol; 1 part 
by weight (16 ounces equal 1 pound) of 
saltpeter; 6 parts by weight (16 ounces 
equal 1 pound) of common salt; 1 part 
by weight (16 ounces equal 1 pound) of 
black manganic oxide or pulverized, 
and mixed with 48 parts by weight (16 
ounces equal 1 pound) of good welding 
sand. 

II. —Filings of the metal to be used m 
welding are mixed with melted borax m 
the usual proportion. To be applied m 
the thickness desired. 

HI _A mixture of 338 parts of 
sodium phosphate and 124 parts of 
boracic acid is used when tbe metal is 
at dark-red heat. The metal is then to be 
brought to a bright-red heat and ham ; 
mereel at the same time. The metal 
easilv softens at a high temperature, and 
TtUfn mallet is b\st. & W ££3 
™ntainin£? carbon should be removea 
from he surface, as success depends upon 
Jheformation of a fusible copper P hos- 
phate, which dissolves a l^f^ 
oxide on the surface, and keeps the latter 
in good condition for welding.

GOLD 



and the gold in them recovered. The 
following method is recommended: 
Dissolve a handful of phosphate of iron 
in boiling water, to which liquor add 
the coloring baths, whereby small 
particles of gold are precipitated. Then 
draw off the water, being careful not to 
dissolve the auriferous sediment at the 
bottom. Free this from all traces of acid 
by washing with plenty of boiling water; 
it will require 3 or 4 separate washings, 
with sufficient time between each to 
allow the water to cool and the sediment 
to settle before pouring off the water. 
Then dry in an iron, vessel by the fire and 
fuse in a covered skittlepot with a flux. 



II, — The collected old coloring baths 
are poured into a sufficiently large pot, 
an optional quantity of nitro-inuriatic 
acid is added, and the pot is placed over 
the fire, during which time the fluid is 
stirred with a wooden stick. It is taken 
from the fire after a while, diluted largely 
with rain water and filtered through 
coarse paper. The gold is recovered 
from the filtered solution with a solution 
of green vitriol which is stored in air- 
tight bottles, then freshened with hot 
water, and .finally smelted wi th borax 
and a lit tle saltpeter. ~ 

Parting with Concentrated Sulphuric 
Acid. —It is not necessary scrupulously to 
observe the exact proportion of the gold 
to the silver. After having prepared the 
auriferous silver, place it in a quantity of 
concentrated sulphuric acid contained in 
a porcelain vessel, and let it come to a 
violent boil. When the acid has either be- 
come saturated and will dissolve no more 
or when solution is complete, remove 
the dissolving vessel from the fire, let it cool 
and, for the purpose of clarifying, pour 
dilute sulphuric acid into the solution. 
Ine dissolved silver is next carefully 
decanted from the gold sediment upon 
tue bottom, another portion of con- 
centrated acid is poured in, and the gold 
is well boiled again, as it will still contain 
traces of silver; this operation may be 
repeated as often as is deemed necessary, 
lhe solut, on) poured into the glass jars, 
is well diluted With water, and the silver 
is then precipitated by placing a sheet 
of copper in the solution. The precipi- 
tote is then freshened with hot water, 
which raa y al so be done by washing upon 
nf =n V l ^ £ uif ^ated silver (sulphate 
!tJ lver l ls , Passed out in linen, dried 
and smelted. The freshened gold, after 
d^ng 1S first smelted with bisulphate of 
of ,1ivl < ? r ? er *? ™>™rt the last traces 
ot silver into sulphate, and then smelted 
witn borax and a little saltpeter.

Simple Specific Gravity Test.— A cer- 
tain quantity of the metal is taken and 
drawn out into a wire, which is to be 
exactly of the same length as one from 
fine silver; of course, both must have 
been drawn through the same hole, 
silver being nearly § lighter than gold, 
it is natural that the one of fine silver 
must be lighter, and the increased weight 
of the wire under test corresponds to the 
percentage of gold contained in it. 

To Make Fat Oil Gold Size.— First thin 
up the fat oil with turpentine to workable 
condition; then mix a little very finely 
ground pigment with the gold size, about 
as much as in a thin priming coat. Make 
tile size as rearly gold color as is con- 
venient; chrome yellow tinted with ver- 
milion is as good as anything for this pur- 
pose. Then thin ready for the brush with 
turpentine, and it will next be in order to 
run the size through a very fine strainer. 
Add japan, as experience or experiment 
may teach, to make it dry tacky about 
the time the leaf is to be laid. Dry slow- 
ly, because the slower the size dries, the 
longer it will hold its proper tackiness 
when it is once in that condition. 

To Dissolve Copper from Gold Articles. 
— Take 2 ounces of proto-sulphate ol 
iron and dissolve it in h a pint of water, 
then add to it in powder 2 ounces oi 
nitrate of potash; boil the mixture tor 
some time, and afterwards pour it into a 
shallow vessel to coo) and crystallise, 
then to every part of the crystallized san 
add 8 ounces of muriatic acid, an 
preserve in a bottle for use. Bqua
