OXIDIZING PROCESSES: 

Aluminum Plating, — I. — To plate iron 
and other metals with pure aluminum, 
deoxidize the pieces with a solution of 
borax and place them in an enameling 
oven, fitted for receiving metallic vapors. 
Raise the temperature to 1,832° to 2,732° 
F. Introduce the aluminum vapors 
generated by heating a quantity of the 
metal on the sand bath. When the 
vapors come in contact with the metallic 
surfaces, the aluminum is deposited. 
The vapors that have not been used or 
are exhausted may be conducted into a 
vessel of water. 

To Copper Aluminum, 
take 

H.- — Sulphate of copper. 30 parts 
Cream of tartar.. . . 30 parts 

Soda 25 parts 

Water 1,000 parts 

The articles to be coppered are merely 
dipped in this bath, but they must be 
^cll cleaned previously. 

Antimony Baths. — I. — By dissolving 
15 parts, by weight, of tartar emetic 
a-nd 15 parts of prepared tartar in 500 
parts of hot water and adding 45-60 
parts of hydrochloric acid and 45-60 
parts of powdered antimony, brass be- 
comes coated in the boiling liquid with 
beautiful antimony colors. In this 
manner it is possible to impart to brass 



golden, copper-red, violet, or bluish-gray 
shades, according to a shorter or longer 
stay of the objects in the liquid. These 
antimony colors possess a handsome 
luster, are permanent, and never change 
in the air. 

II, — Carbonate of soda, 200 parts, by 
weight; sulphide of antimony, 50 parts; 
water, 1,000 parts. Heat the whole in 
a porcelain^ capsule for 1 hour, keeping 
constantly in ebullition; next, filter the 
solution, which, on cooling, leaves a 
precipitate, which boil again with the 
liquid for one-half hour, whereupon th 
bath is ready for use. 

To Coat Brass Articles with Antimony 
Colors. — Dissolve 15 parts, by weight, of 
tartar emetic and 15 parts, by weight, of 
powdered tartar in 500 parts, by weight, 
of hot water and add 50 parts, by weight 
of hydrochloric acid, and 50 parts, by 
weight, of powdered antimony. In+c 
this mixture, heated to a boil, the 
mersed articles become covered wit' 
luster colors, a golden shade appearin 
at first, which is succeeded by cne 
copper red. If the objects remain ionge 
in the liquid, the color passes into viole 
and finally into bluish gray. 

Brassing. — I. — To brass small articl 
of iron or steel drop them into a our rt 
water and \ ounce each of sulphate 
copper and protoehloride of tin. St 
the articles in this solution until desire 
color is obtained.

trated cold blue vitriol solution. A red 
precipitate is obtained from the vitriol, 
which falls to the bottom at 167 b. 
Next a wooden sieve, fitted to the vessel 
is put into the liquid with the polished 
brass articles. Toward the end of the 
second minute the golden color is usually 
dark enough. The sieve with the arti- 
cles is taken out and the latter are 
washed and dried in sawdust. If they 
remain in the copper solution they soon 
assume a green color, which in a short 
time passes into yellow and bluish green, 
and finally into the iridescent colors. 
These shades must be produced slowly 
at a temperature of 133° to 135° F. 

To Give a Green Color to Gold Jew-

Remove the pieces from the bath in a 
few minutes and rub them with fine sand 
on a moist rag. Brilliancy will thus be 
obtained. To improve the appearance, 
applv a brass wire brush. The nickel- 
ing is said to be more solid and beauti- 
ful than that obtained by the electrical 

method. . , . 

Brilliancy may be also imparted D> 
means of a piece of buff glued on a

Palladiumizing Watch Movements.— 
Palladium is successfully employed for 
coatine parts of timepieces and other 
pieces of metals to preserve them against 
oxidation. To prepare a. palladium 
bath use the following ingredients: 
Chloride of palladium, 10 parts, by 
weight; phosphate of ammonia, 100 
parts; phosphate of soda, 300 parts; 
benzoic acid, 8 parts; water, 2,000 
parts. 

Metal Browning by Oxidation.— The 
article ought first to be cleaned with 
either nitric acid or muriatic acid, then 
immersed in an acid affecting the metal 
and dried in a warm place. A light 
coating is thus formed.. For a second 
coating acetic or formic acid is used 
preferably for aluminum, nickel, and 
copper; but for iron and steel, muriatic 
or nitric acid. After cleaning, the. arti- 
cle is placed in a solution of tannin or 
gallic acid, and is then dried in a warm 
place as before. The second coating is 
of a yellowish-brown color. On placing 
it near the fire, the color can be deepened 
until it becomes completely black; care 
must be taken to withdraw it when the 
desired shade is produced. Instead or 
the acids employed for the first coating, 
ammonia may be used. 

, Silvering by Oxidation. — The oxidiz- 
ing of silver darkens it, and eives an an- 
tique appearance that is highly prized. 

L— The salts of silver are colorless 
when the acids, the elements of which 



enter into their composition, are not col- 
ored, but they generally blacken on ex- 

Eosure to light. It is easy, therefore, to 
lacken silver and obtain its oxide; it is 
sufficient to place it in contact with a 
sulphide, vapor of sulphur, sulphohydric 
acids, such as the sulphides or polysul- 
phides of potash, soda, dissolved in water 
and called eau de barege. The chlorides 
play the same part, and the chloride of 
lime in solution or simply Javelle water 
may be used. It is used hot in order to 
accelerate its action. The bath must be 
prepared new for each operation for two 
reasons: (1) It is of little value; (2) 
the sulphides precipitate rapidly and 
give best effects only at the time of their 
direct precipitations. The quantity of 
the reagent in solution, forming the bath, 
depends upon the thickness of the deposit 
of silver. When this is trifling, the oxi- 
dation penetrates the entire deposit and 
the silver exfoliates in smaller scales, 
leaving the copper bare. It is neces- 
sary, therefore, m this case to operate 
with dilute baths inclosing only about 
45 grains of oxidizant at most per quart. 
The operation is simple: Heat the nec- 
essary quantity of water, add the sul- 
phide or chloride and agitate to ettec 
the solution of the mixture, and then al 
once plunge in the silver-plated articles, 
leaving them immersed only for. a le^ 
seconds, which exposure is sufficient tc 
cover it with a pellicle of deep Wack-Uu» 
silver. After withdrawing they an 
plunged in clean cold water, rinsed 

and either left mat or else pol

PATINA OXIDIZING PROCESSES: 

Patina of Art Bronzes. — For all 
patinas, whether the ordinary brown 
of commerce, the green of the Bary e 
bronzes, or the dark-orange tint of the 
Florentine bronzes, a brush is used with 
pigments varying according to the shade 
desired and applied to the metal after it 
is warmed. Recipes are to be met with 
on every hand that have not been pat- 
ented. But the details of the operation 
are the important thing, and often the 
effect is produced by a handicraft which 
it is difficult to penetrate. 

I. — A dark tint may be obtained by 
cleaning the object and applying a coat 
of hydrosulphate of ammonia; then, 
after drying it, by rubbing with a brush 
smeared with red chalk and plumbago. 
The copper may also be moistened with 
a dilute solution of chloride of platina 
and warmed slightly, or still by plunging 
it in a warm solution of the hydroclilo- 
rate of antimony. For the verde an- 
tique a solution is recommended com- 
posed of 200 grams of acetic acid oi S 
strength, the same quantity of common 
vinegar, 30 parts, by weight, ot .car- 
bonate of ammonia; 10 parts, by weigm, 
of sea salt; with the same quantities . m

ciled over with this several times, each 
time allowing the solution to dry be- 
fore putting on any more. The process 
is slow, but makes an elegant finish. 

Green Patina Upon Copper. — To pro- 
duce a green patina upon copper take 
tartaric acid, dilute it half and naif wit' 
boiling water; coat the copper with this 1 
allow to dry for one day and rub the ap 
plied layer off again the next day wit 
oakum. The coating must be done if 
dry weather, else no success will be o 1 
tained. Take hydrochloric acid an 
dilute it half and half with boiling wate 
but the hydrochloric acid should b 
poured in the water, not vice-vers 
which is dangerous. In this hydr 
chloric acid water dissolve as much zinc 
as it can solve and allow to settle. The 
clear liquid is again diluted half with 
boiling water and the copper is coated 
with this a few times. 

Black Patina — Black patina is ob 
tained by coating with tallow the pieces 
to be oxidized and lighting with a rosin 
torch. Finally, wipe the reliefs and let 
dry. 

Blue -Black Patina.— Use a dilute so- 
lution of chloride of antimony m water 
and add a little free hydrochloric acid.

This solution must always be freshly 
prepared, and is the best for the purpose. 
Neither galvanizing nor amalgamating 
will produce the desired result. Special 
care must be taken that the aluminum 
is free from iron, otherwise black patches 
will arise which cannot be removed. 
Vessels platinized in this way must not 
be cleaned with substances such as sea- 
sand, but with a 5 to 10 per cent solution 
of oxalic acid in water, followed by thor- 
ough-rinsing in water. These vessles 
are said to be specially suitable for evap- 
orating purposes. 

Platinizing Copper and Brass. — I. — The 
articles are coated with a thin layer of 
platinum in a boiling solution of platinum 
sal ammoniac, 1 part; sal ammoniac, 8 
parts; and water, 40 parts, and next pol- 
ished with chalk. A mixture of equal 
parts of platinum sal ammoniac and tar- 
ter may also be rubbed on the objects. 
Steel and iron articles can be platinized

II.— Heat 800 parts of sal amm 0llia( , 
and 10 parts of platinum sal ammoni^ 
to the boiling point with 400 p arts ^ 
water, in a porcelain dish, and p^ ace ^ 
articles to be platinized into this, wh ere 
by they soon become covered with . 
coating of platinum. They are then re , 
moved from the liquid, dried and n e 1 
ished with whiting. 

Platinizing on Glass or Porcelain 

First dissolve the platinum at a moder, 
ate temperature in aqua regia, and next 
evaporate the solution to dryness, ob. 
serving the following rules: When th e 
solution commences to turn thick it i 3 
necessary to diminish the fire, while 
carrying the evaporation so far that the 
salt becomes dry, but the solution should 
not be allowed to acquire a brown color, 
which occurs if the heat is too strong'. 
The result of this first operation is 
chloride of platina. When the latter 
has cooled oil it should be dissolved in 
alcohol (95 per cent). The dissolution 
accomplished, which takes place at the 
end of 1 or 8 hours, throw the solution 
gradually into four times its weight of 
essence of lavender, then put into a well- 
closed flask. 

For use, dip a brush into the solution 
and apply it upon the objects to be plat- 
inized, let dry and place in the muffle, 
leaving them in the oven for about one- 
half hour. In this operation one should 
be guided as regards the duration J 
the baking by the hardness or fusibility 
of the objects treated. The platimza- 
tion accomplished, take a cotton clo u, 
dipped into whiting in the state of mj>, 
and rub the platinated articles with tins, 
rinsing with water afterwards. 

Platinizing Metals.— Following a* 
several processes of platinizing on mev 

al It is understood that the metals s to bj

cttVERING, SILVER-PLATING, 
DESILVERING :

coating of black will be weaker and the 
shade handsomer. 

Britannia Silver -Plating. — I. — Ihe 
Jelf should first be cleaned an 1 then 
rubbed by means of a wet cloth witn a 
Sch of powder obtained by mixing to- 
Ker: titrate of silver, 1 part; cyanide 
| potassium, 2 parts; chalk, 5 parts 
Then wipe with a dry cloth, and polish 
well with rouge to give brilliancy. 

T j_By the electric method the metal 
is simply plunged into a hot saturated 
solution of crude potassium carbonate, 
and the plating is then done directly, 
using a strong electrical current. Ine 
potassium carbonate solution dissolves 
the surface of the britannia metal and 
thus enables- the silver to take a strong 
hold on the article. 

To Silver Brass, Bronze, Copper, etc. 
—I,— In order to silver copper, brass, 
bronze, or coppered metallic articles 
dissolve 10 parts of lunar caustic in 500 
parts of distilled water, and 35 parts ot 
potassium cyanide (98 per cent) in 500 
parts of distilled water; mix both solu- 
tions with stirring, heat to 176° to 194 
P. in an enameled vessel, and enter the 
articles, well cleansed of fat and impuri- 
ties, until a uniform coating has formed. 

II. — Zinc, brass, and copper are sil- 
vered by applying a paste of the follow- 
ing composition: Ten parts of s d ver 
nitrate dissolved in 50 parts of distilled 
water, and 9,5 parts of potassium cya- 
nide dissolved in distilled water; mix, 
stir, and filter. Moisten 100 parts of 
whiting and 400 parts of powdered tartar 
with enough of the above solution to 
make a paste-like mass, which is applied 
by means of a brush on the well-cleaned 
objects. After the drying of this coat- 
ing, rinse off, and dry in sawdust. 

III. — To silver brass and copper by 
friction, rub on the articles, previously 



AND | cleaned of grease, a paste of silver 



;±eiiiie(j ui grease, a paste oi suveT 
chloride, 10 parts; cooking salt, 20 parts; 
powdered tartar, 20 parts; and the nec- 
essary water, using a rag. 

Desilvering. — I. — It often happens in 
plating that, notwithstanding all pre- 
cautions, some pieces have failed and it 
is necessary to commence the work 
again. For removing the silver that has 
been applied, a rapid method is to take 
sulphuric acid, 100 parts, and nitrate of 
potash, 10 parts. Put the sulphuric 
acid and the nitrate of potash (saltpeter) 
in a vessel of stoneware or porcelain, 
heated on the water bath. When the 
silver has been removed from the cop- 
per, rinse the object several times and 
recommence the silvering. This bath 
may be used repeatedly, taking care each 
tima to put it in a stoppered bottle 
When it has been saturated with silve 
and has no more strength, decant th 
deposit, boil the liquor to dryness, ad 
the residue to the deposit, and melt m 
crucible to regenerate the metal. 

II. To dissolve the silver covering of 

a metallic object, a bath is made use of, 
composed of 66 per cent sulphun* acid 
3 parts, and 40 per cent nitric acid, 1 
part This mixture is heated to about 
176° F and the objects to be desilvered 
are suspended in it by means of a copper 
wire The operation is accomplished in 
a few seconds The objects are washed 
and then dried in sawdust.

P n_A brilliant silver color may be 
imparted to iron (from which ^grease 
has been previously removed) by treat 
in* it with the following solution: Foity 
narts by weight, chloride of antimony, 
? 0 par£by weight, powdered arsemous 
acid; and 80 parts levigated hematite 
are mixed with 1,000 parts of 90 per 
cent alcohol and gently heated for half 
an hour on a water bath. A partial so- 
lution takes place, and a small cotton pad 
is then dipped in the liquid and applied 
with a gentle pressure to the iron. A 
thin film consisting of arsenic and ^ an- 
timony is precipitated, as described by 
Dr. Langbein, in his "Handbuch der 
galv. Metallniederschlage." The bril- 
liancy of the effect depends upon the 
care with which the iron has previously 
been polished. 

To Silver-Plate Metals. — I. — Nitrate 
of silver, 30 parts, by weight; caustic 

?>tash, 30 parts; distilled water, 100 parts, 
ut the nitrate of silver into the water; 
one-quarter hour afterwards add the pot- 
ash, and, when the solution is done, fil- 
ter. It is sufficient to dip the objects to 
be silvered into this bath, moving them 
about in it for 1 or 2 minutes at most; 
then rinsing and drying in sawdust. It 
is necessary to pickle the pieces before 
using the bath. To make the nitrate of 
silver one's self, take 30 parts of pure 
silver and 60 parts of nitric acid, and 
when the metal is dissolved add the 
caustic potash and the water. 

. — Kayser's silvering liquid, which 
is excellent for all kinds of metals, is 
prepared from lunar caustic, 11 parts; 
sodium hyposulphite, 20 parts; sal am- 
? 0 *K? C > 12 parts; whiting, 20 parts; and 
distilled water, £00 parts. The articles 
must be cleaned well.

especially articles of copper and brass, aw 
appearance similar to silver, they ate 
made perfectly bright. The powder „* 
the mosaic silver is mixed with six ti me8 
the volume of bone ashes, adding enough 
water to cause a paste and rubbing tHis 
on the metallic surface by means 0 f » 
cork of suitable shape. In order to 
silver paper by means of this preparation 
it is ground with white of egg, diluted 
mucilage, or varnish, and treated like a 
paint- 
Pastes for Silvering.— I— Carbonate 
of lime, 65 parts; sea salt, GO parts; 
cream of tartar, 35 parts; nitrate o\ 
silver, 20 parts. Bray all in a mortar, 
not adding the carbonate of lime until 
the other substances are reduced to a 
fine powder. Next, add a little water to 
form a homogeneous paste, which is 

E reserved in blue bottles away from the 
ght. For use, put a little of this paste 
on a small pad and rub the article with it. 

II. — Articles of zinc, brass, or copper 
may also be silver-plated by applying to 
them a pasty mass of the following 
composition: 'First dissolve 10 parts, by 
weight, of nitrate of silver in 50 parts, by 
weight, of distilled water; also 25 parts, 
by weight, of potassium cyanide in suffi- 
cient distilled water to dissolve it. Pour 
the two together, stir well, and filter. 
Now 100 parts, by weight, of whiting or 
levigated chalk and 400 parts, by weight, 
of ootassium bitartrate, finely powdered, 
arc moistened with the above solution 
sufficiently to form a soft paste, which 
may be applied to the objects, previously 
well cleansed, with a brush. After this 
coating has dried well, rinse it ott, ana 
dry the object in clean sawdust, 



Resilveriug. — I. — Take 100 parts by

Tin Silver-Plating.— Prepare a solu- 
tion of 3 parts, by weight of bismuth 
subnitrate in 10 parts of nitric acid of 
1 4 specific gravity, to which add a solu- 
tion of 10 parts of tartar and 40 parts of 
hydrochloric acid in 1,000 parts of water. 
In the mixture of these solutions im- 
merse the tin articles freed from grease 
and oxide. The pulverous b«muth 
precipitated on the surface is rubbed otr, 
whereupon the objects appear dark steel 
gray. For silvering prepare a mixture 
of 10 parts of silver chloride; 30 parts of 
cooking salt; 20 parts of tartar, and 100 
parts of powdered chalk, which is rubbed 
in a slightly moist state on the bismuth 
surface of the tin articles, using a flannel 
rag. The silver separates only in a 
very thin layer, and must be protected 
against power and light before tarnish- 
ing by a coating of preservative or cel- 
luloid varnish. 

Zinc Contact Silver-Plating. — Accord- 
ing to Buchner, 10 parts, by weight, of 
silver nitrate is dissolved in water and 
precipitated by the addition of hydro- 
chloric acid in the form of silver chloride, 
•which is washed several times in clean 
■water; now dissolve 70 parts, by weight, 
o£ spirit of sal ammoniac in water, and 
add to it 40 parts, by weight, of soda crys- 
tals, 40 parts, by weight, of pure potas- 
sium cyanide, and 15 parts, by weight, of 
common salt. Now thin down the 
compound with sufficient distilled water 
to make a total of 1,000 parts. 

Tin Plating of Lead. — Lead plates are 
best tinned by plating. For this purpose 
a table with a perfectly even iron surface 
and provided with vertical raised edges 
to prevent the melted metal from flowing 
ployed. The lead is poured 



on this table, and covered with grease to 
prevent oxidation of the surface. As 
soon as the lead is congealed, melted tin 
is poured over it, care being taken that 
the tin is sufficiently heated to remeltthe 
surface of the lead and combine thorough- 
ly with it. m When the plate is sufficiently 
cooled, it is turned over, and the lower 
surface treated in the same way. The 
plate, thus tinned on both sides, is then 
placed between rollers, and can be rolled 
into very thin sheets without injury to 
the tin coating. These sheets, doubly 
coated with tin by this process, are spe- 
cially adapted for lining cases intended 
for the transport of biscuits,, chocolate, 
candies, tea, snuff, etc. If lead plates 
are only to be tinned superficially, the„ 
are heated to a tolerably high tempera- 
ture, and sprinkled with powdered rosin; 
melted tin is then rubbed on the surfac 
of the plate with a ball of tow. It i 
advisable to give the lead a fairly thic 
coating of tin, as the latter is rendere 
thinner by the subsequent rolling. 

VARIOUS RECIPES: 

To Ascertain whether an Article 
ITickeled, Tinned, or Silvered.— Whe 
necessary to ascertain quickly and accur 
ately the nature of the white metal cover- 
ing an object, the following process «' 
be found to give excellent results: 

Nickeled Surface.— If the article has 
nickel coating, a drop of hydrochlo 
acid, deposited on a spot clean and tr 
from grease, will quickly develop a gree 
ish tint. If the object is kept fox -5 or 
minutes in a solution composed ot o 
parts o sea salt and 110 parts of water,

Polishes for Aluminum.--!.^ 

Mouray recommends the use of an emul- 
sion of equal parts of rum and oliv e 0 j] 
made by shaking these liquids togethw 
in a bottle. When a burnishing stooe ia 
used, the peculiar black streaks first 
appearing should not cause vexation 
since they do not injure the metal i n th e 
least, and may be removed with a woolen 
rag. The object in question may also 
be brightened in potash lye, in which 
case, however, care must be taken not to 
have the lye too strong. For cleaning 
purposes benzol has been found best. 

XL — Aluminum is susceptible of taking 
a beautiful polish, but it is not white 
like that of silver or nickel, rather 
slightly bluish, like tin. The shade can 
be improved. First, the grease is to be 
removed from the object with pumice 
stone. Then, for polishing, use is made 
of an emery paste mingled with tallow, 
forming cakes which are rubbed on the 
polishing brushes. Finally, rouge pow- 
der is employed with oil of turpentine. 

POLISHES FOR BRASS, BRONZE, 
COPPER, ETC.: 

Objects of polished copper, bronze, 
brass, and other alloys of copper tarnish 
through water and it is sometimes neces- 
sary to give them again their bright ap- 
pearance. Pickle the articles in an acid 
bath; wash them next in a neutral bath; 
dry them, and subsequently rub them 
with a polishing powder. Such is the 
general formula; the processes indicated 
below are but variants adapted to divers 
cases and recommended by disinterested 
experimenters:

POLISHES FOR FLOORS. 

i —Throw a handful of permanganate 
notash crystals into a pail of boiling 
water.and apply the mixture as hot as 
nossTble to tZ floor with a large flat 
Csh If the stain produced is not 
dark 'enough, apply one or two more 
coats as desired, leaving each wash to 
dry thoroughly before applying another 
If it is desired to polish the surface with 
beeswax, a coat of size should be applied 
to the boards before staining, as tins 
gives depth and richness to the color. 
After 3 or 4 days, polish well with a mix- 
ture of turpentine and beeswax. _ A few 
cents will cover the cost of both size and 
permanganate of potash. 

II— Potash. 1 part 

Water * parts 

Yellow beeswax . . \ . 5 parts 
Hot water, a sufficient quantity. 
Emulsify the wax by boiling it in the 
water in which the potash has been dis- 
solved; stir the whole time. The exact 
amount of boiling is determined by the 
absence of any free water in the mass. 
Then remove the vessel from the fire, 
and gently pour in a little boiling water, 
and stir the mixture carefully. If a fat- 
like mass appears without traces of 
watery particles, one may know the mass 
is in a fit condition to be liquefied by the 
addition of more hot water without the 
water separating. Then put in the water 
to the extent of 200 to 225 parts, and 
reheat the compound for 5 to 10 minutes, 
without allowing it to reach the boiling 
point. Stir constantly until the mixture 
18 cool, so as to prevent "the separation of 
the wax, when a cream-like mass results 
which gives a quick and brilliant polish 
on woodwork, if applied in the usual way, 
piece of flannel rag, and polished 
with another piece of flannel. 



Colored Floor Polishes. — Yellow ; Cans- 
tie soda solution, 7^ parts, mixed with 1£ 
to 2 parts of finely powdered ocher, heated 
with 2£ parts of yellow wax, and stirred 
until uniformly mixed. A reddish-brown 
color may be obtained by adding % parts 
of powdered umber to the above mixture. 

Nut Brown. — I. — Natural umber, \ 
part; burnt umber, 1 part; and yellow 
ocher, 1 part, gives a fine red-brown 
color when incorporated with the same 
wax and soda mixture. 



II. — Tieat 5 pounds of wax with 15 
pounds of caustic soda lye of 3° Be. so 
that a uniform wax milk results; boil 
with \ pound of annatto, 3 pounds of 
yellow ocher, and 2 pounds of burnt 
umber. 

Mahogany Brown. — Boil 5 pounds of 
wax with 15 pounds of caustic soda lye 
as above. Then add 7 pounds of burnt 
umber very finely powdered, making it 
into a uniform mass by boiling again. 

Yellow Ocher. — The wax milk obtained 
as above is boiled with 5 pounds, of yel- 
low ocher. 

The mass on cooling has the consist- 
ency of a salve. If it is to be used for 
rubbing the floor it is stirred with suf- 
ficient boiling water so as to form a 
fluid of the consistency of thin syrup or 
oil This is applied very thin on the 
floor, using a brush; then it is allowed 
to dry only half way, and is rubbed with 
a stiff floor brush. The pohshing is 
continued with a woolen rag until a

for each gallon of spirit. The latter 
should be of 63 to 64° over-proof. A 
weak spirit is not suitable and does not 
make a good polish. A few drops of 
pure linseed oil make the polish work 
more freely. 

POLISHES FOR FURNITURE. 

First make a paste to fill cracks as fol- 
lows: Whiting, plaster of Paris, pumice 
stone, litharge, equal parts; japan dryer, 
boiled linseed oil, turpentine, coloring 
matter of sufficient quantity. Rub the 
solids intimately with a mixture of 1 part 
of the japan, % parts of the linseed oil, 
and 3 parts of turpentine, coloring to 
suit with Vandyke brown or sienna. 
Lay the filling on with a brush, let it set 
for about 20 minutes, and then rub off 
clean except where it is to remain. In 
2 or 3 days it will be hard enough to 
polish. B 

After the surface has been thus pre- 
pared, the application of a coat of first- 
class copal varnish is in order It is 
recommended that the varnish be ap- 
Ul a ^erately warm room, as it 
is injured by becoming chilled in drying.

After a satisfactorily smooth and reg- 



ular surface has been obtained, tW I 
polishing proper may be done. This 
may be accomplished by manual labor 
and dexterity, or consist in the appli CEU . 
tion of a very thin, even coat of a very 
fine, transparent varnish. 

If the band-polishing method be ' 
preferred, it may be pursued by rubbing 
brisklv and thoroughly with the followt 
ing finishing polish: 

I. — Alcohol 8 ounces 

Shellac . . ■ ■ £ drachm 3 

Gum benzoin 2 drachms 

Best poppy oil % drachms 

Dissolve the shellac and gum in the 
alcohol in a warm place, with frequent 
agitation, and, when cold, add the poppy 
oil. This may be applied on the end of a 
cylindrical rubber made by tightly rolling 
a* piece of flannel which has been torn^ not 
cut, into strips 4 to 6 inches wide. 

A certain "oily sweating" of articles 
of polished wood occurs which has been 
ascribed to the oil used in polishing, hut 
has been found to be due to a waxy sub- 
stance present in shellac, which is often 
used in polishing. During the operation 
of polishing, this wax enters into close 
combination with the oil, forming a soft, 
greasy mass, which prevents the varnish 
from ever becoming really hard. This 
greasy matter exudes in the course of time. 
The remedy is to use only shellac from 
which the vegetable wax has been com- 
pletely removed. This is accomplished 
by making a strong solution of the shellac 
in alcohol and then shaking it up wifj 
fresh seed lac or filtering it through seed 
lac. In this way the readily soluble 
rosins in the seed lac are dissolved, ana 
with them traces of colonng matter. M 
the same time the vegetable wax, wiuc 
is only slightly soluble, is deposited, m 
shellac solution which has exchanged i s 
vegetable wax for rosin is not yet su«a0| 
for fine furniture polishing. It 1S j 
sufficiently taken up by the wood, j an 
an essential oil must be added to gi^^ 
the necessarv properties, one oi t

Bee chwood Furniture.— The wood of 
the red beech is known to acquire, by the 
f s f ordinary shellac polish a dirty 
Sow color, and by the use of white 
S\sh prepared from bleached shellac, 
K unsightfy ^ray-white color, There- 
fore where light colors are desired, only 
filtered shellac polish .should be em- 
ployed, and in order to impart some fire 
Re naturally dull color of the beech- 
wood the admixture of a solution oi 
dragon's blood in alcohol for a red shade, 
or turmeric in alcohol for yellow may be 
used. A compound of the red and yel- 
low liquids gives a good orange shade. 
A few trials will soon show how much 
coloring matter may be added to the 
polish. 

Polishes for Glass. — I. — Mix calcined 
magnesia with purified benzine to a semi- 
iiquid paste. Hub the glass with this 
mixture by means of a cotton wad, until 
it is bright. 

II. — Crush to powder cologne chalk, 
60 parts, by weight; tripoli, 30 parts, by 
weight; bole, 15 parts, by weight. For 
use moisten the glass a little, dip a linen 
rag into the powder and rub the glass 
Until it is clean. 

HI. — Tin ashes may be employed 
with advantage. The glass is rubbed 
with this substance and then washed off 
with a piece of soft felt. In this manner 
a very handsome polish is obtained. 

Polishes for Ivory, Bone, etc. — I. — 
First rub with a piece of linen soaked 
with a paste made of Armenian bole 
and oleic acid. Wash with Marseilles 
soap, dry, rub with a chamois skin, and 
ntially render it bright with an old piece 
of silk. If the ivory is scratched, it may 
be smoothed by means of English red 
stuff on a cloth, or even with a piece of 

5 lass if the scratches are rather deep, 
n the hollow parts of ivory objects the 
paste can be made to penetrate by means 
of an old toothbrush. 

H. — Tortoise-shell articles have a way 
Of getting dull and dingy looking. To 
r epohsh dip the finger in linseed oil and 



rub over the whole surface. Yery little 
oil should be used, and if the article is a 
patterned one it may be necessary to use 
a soft brush to get it into the crevices. 
Then rub with the palm, of the hand 
until all oil has disappeared, and the 
shell feels hot and looks aright and shiny. 

Marble Polishing. — Polishing includes 
five operations. Smoothing the rough- 
ness left on the surface is done by rub- 
bing the marble with a piece of moist 
sandstone; for moldings either wooden 
or iron runners are used, crushed, and 
wet sandstone, or sand, more or less fine, 
according to the degree of polish re- 
quired, being thrown under them. The 
second process is continued rubbing with 

Eieces of pottery without enamel, which 
ave only been baked once, also wet. If 
a brilliant polish is required, Gothland 
stone instead of pottery is used, and 
potter's clay or fuller's earth is placed 
beneath the muller. This operation is 
performed upon granites and porphyry 
with emery and a lead muller, the upper 
part of which is incrusted with the mix- 
ture until reduced by friction to clay or 
impalpable powder. As the polish de- 
pends almost entirely upon these twe 
operations, care must be taken that thej 
are performed with a regular and steady 
movement. When the marble has re- 
ceived the first polish, the flaws, cavities, 
and soft spots are sought out and filled 
with mastic of a suitable color. 

This mastic is usually composed oi a 
mixture of yellow wax, rosim and Bur- 
gundy pitch, mixed with a little sulphur 
and plaster passed through a fine sieve 
which gives it the consistency of a thick 
paste; to color this paste to a tone anal- 
ogous to the ground tints or natural 
clment of the material upon which it i 
placed, lampblack and rouge, with 
little of the prevailing color of the m 
terial are added. For green and rec 
marbles this mastic is sometimes made

time take another cushion of dry rags, 
Sb with it lightly, brush away any for- 
Sm substance which might scratch the 
marble, and a perfect polish will be ob- 
taiaed. A little alum mixed with the 
water used penetrates the pores of the 
marble, and gives it a speedier polish. 
This polish spots very easily and is soon 
tarnished and destroyed by dampness. 
It is necessary when purchasing articles 
of polished marbles to subject them to 
the test of water; if there is too much 
alum, the marble absorbs the water and 
a whitish spot is left. 

POLISHING POWDERS. 

Polishing powders are advantageously 
prepared according to the following re-

Non-Explosive Liquid Metal Polish. — 
Although m a liquid form, it does not 
necessarily follow that a liquid polish ia 
less economical than pastes, because the 
efficiency of both is dependent upon the 
amount of stearic or oleic acid they con- 
tain, and a liquid such as that given be- 
low is as rich in this respect as most of 
the 1 pastes, especially those containing 
much mineral jelly and earthy matters 
which are practically inert, and can only 
be considered as filling material. Thus 
it is a fact that an ounce of fluid polish 
may possess more polishing potency than 
an equal weight of the paste. Propor- 
tions are: Sixteen pounds crude oleic acid; 
4 pounds tasteless mineral oil; 5 pounds 
kieselguhr; 1^ ounces lemon oil. Make 
the earthy matter into a paste with the 
mixed fluids and gradually thin out, 
avoiding lumps. Apply with one rag, 
and finish with another. 

Miscellaneous Metal Polishes. — I. — 
Articles of polished copper, such as clocks, 
stove ornaments, etc., become tarnished 
very quickly. To restore their brilliancy 
dip a brush in strong vinegar and brush 
the objects to be cleaned. Next pass 
through water and dry in sawdust. A 
soap water, in which some carbonate of 
soda has been dissolved, will do the sam" 
service.

chinery by the chemical laboratory of 
the industrial museum of Batavia: 

Oil of turpentine 15 parts

POLISHES FOR STEEL AND IRON. 

The polishing of steel must always 
be preceded by a thorough smoothing, 
either with oilstone dust, fine emery, or 
coarse rouge. If any lines are left to be 
erased by means of fane rouge, the oper- 
ation becomes tedious and is rarely suc- 
cessful. The oilstone dust is applied on 
&n iron or copper polisher. When it is 
esired to preserve the angles sharp, at 
J sh °ulder, for instance, the polisher 
would be of steel. When using dia- 
K tine an iron polish.

s - and for flat surfaces, discs or large 



zmc or tin polishers, although glass is 
preferable to either of these. After 
each operation with oilstone dust, coarse 
rouge, etc., the polisher, cork, etc., must 
be changed, and the object should be 
cleaned well, preferably by soaping, 
perfect cleanliness being essential to 
success. Fine rouge or diamantine 
should be made into a thick paste with 
oil; a little is then taken on the polisher 
or glass and worked until quite dry. As 
the object is thus not smeared over, a 
black polish is more readily obtained, 
and the process gets on better if the 
surface be cleaned from time to time. 

For Fine Steel. — Take equal parts 
(by weight) of ferrous sulphate — green 
vitriol — and sodium chloride — cooking 
salt— mix both well together by grind- 
ing in a mortar and subject the mix- 
ture to red heat in a mortar or a dish. 
Strong fumes will develop, and the mass 
begin to flow. When no more fumes 
arise, the vessel is removed from the 
fire and allowed to cool. A brown 
substance is obtained with shimmering 
scales, resembling mica. The mass is 
now treated with water, partly in order 
to remove the soluble salt, partly m 
order to wash out the lighter portions 
of the non-crystallized oxide, which yield 
an excellent polishing powder. Th 
fire must be neither too strong nor too 
long continued, otherwise the powder 
turns black and very hard, losing its 
good qualities. The more distinct the

POLISHES FOR WOOD: 

See also Polishes for Furniture, Floors 
and Pianos. 

In the usual method of French pol- 
ishing, the pad must be applied along 
curved lines, and with very slight pres- 
sure, if the result is to be uniform. To 
do this requires much practice and the 
work is necessarily slow. Another dis- 
advantage is that the oil is apt to sweat 
out afterwards, necessitating further 
treatment. According to a German 
patent all difficulty can be avoided by 
placing between the rubber and its cov- 
ering a powder composed of clay or 
loam.or better, the powder obtained by 
grinding fragments of terra cotta or of 
yellow bricks. The powder is mois- 
tened with oil for use. The rubber will 
then give a fine polish, without any 
special delicacy of manipula lion and 
with mere backward and forward rub- 
bing in straight lines, and the oil will not 
sweat out subsequently. Another ad- 
vantage is that no priming is wanted, 
as the powder fills up the pores. The 

E nC V f lhe poW( ^ r also makes the 
polish adhere more firmly to the wood.

After the applied mixture has become 
dry, rub it down, polish with glass p ow 
der, and once more coat with the sam e 
mixture. After this _ filling and a ft er 
rubbing off with stickwood chips or 
fine sea grass, one or two coats of shellac 
are put on (white shellac with wood 
alcohol for oak, brown shellac for cherry 
and walnut). This coating is cut do^a 
with sandpaper and given a coat of var- 
nish, either polishing varnish, which is 
polished off with the ball of the hand or 
a soft brush, or with interior varnish, 
which is rubbed down with oil and 
pumice stone. This polish is glass hard, 
transparent, of finer luster, and resistive. 
Hard Wood Polish. — In finishing hard 
wood with a wax polish the wood is first 
coated with a "filler," which is omitted 
in the case of soft wood. The filler is 
made from some hard substance, very 
finely ground; sand is used by some man- 
ufactures. 

The polish is the same as for soft 
wood. The simplest method of apply- 
ing wax is by a heated iron, scraping off 
the surplus, and then rubbing with a 
cloth. It is evident that this method is 
especially laborious; and for that reason 
solution of the wax is desirable. It may 
be dissolved rather freely in turpentine 
spirit, and is said to be soluble also in 
kerosene oil. . . 

The following recipes give varmsli-liKe 

polishes:

parts of sandarac in ISO parts of spl^

made as follows: 

White lac 1J pounds 

Powdered borax 1 ounce 

Alcohol 3 pints 

The lae should be thoroughly dried, 
especially if it has been kept under 
water, and, in any case, after being 
crushed, it should be left in a warm place 
for a few hours, in order to remove every 
trace of moisture. The crushed lac and 
Wax are then added to the spirit, and 
the mixture is stirred frequently until 
solution is effected, after which the polish 



solution is effected, after which the polish 
should be strained through muslin. 

IX. — To restore the gloss of polished 
wood which has sweated, prepare a 
mixture of 100 parts of linseed oil, 750 
P"ts of ether, 1,000 parts of rectified oil 
ot turpentine, and 1,000 parts of petro- 
leum benzine, perfumed, if desired, with 
* strongly odorous essential oil, and 
wiored, if required, with cuicuma, or- 
iean, or alkanna. The objects to be 
^eated are rubbed thoroughly with this 
fixture, using a woolen rag. 



MISCELLANEOUS POLISHING 

AGENTS: 

Polishing Agent which may also he 
used for Gilding and Silvering. — The 

following mediums hitherto known as 
possessing the aforenamed properties, 
lose these qualities upon having been kept 
for some time, as the metal salt is partly 
reduced. Furthermore, it has not been 
possible to admix reducing substances 
such as zinc to these former polishing 
agents, since moisture causes the metal 
to precipitate. The present invention 
obviates these evils. The silver or gold 
salt is mixed with chalk, for instance, in 
a dry form. To this mixture, fine dry 
powders of one or more salts (e. g., am- 
monia compounds) in whose solutions 
the metal salt can enter are added; if re- 
quired, a reducing body, such as zinc, 
may be added at the same time. Tbe 
composition is pressed firmly together 
and forms briquettes, in which condition 
the mass keeps well. For use, all that 
is necessary is to scrape off a little of the 
substance and to prepare it with water. 

Silver Polishing Balls.— This polishing 
agent is a powder made into balls bj 
means of a. binding medium and enjoys 
much popularity ia Germany. It * 
prepared by adding 5 parts of levigate* 
chalk to 2 parts of yellow tnpoli, mmn< 
the two powders well and making into 
stiff paste with very weak gum wate 
— \ part gum arabic to 12 parts of wate 
This dough is finally shaped b y> han< 
into balls of the size of a P'S^VJff 
The balls are put aside to dry on boarc 
in a moderately warm room, and whe 
completely hard are wrapped in tin-toi 
paper.

To Polish Paintings on Wood. Ac- 
cording to the statements of able cabinet 
makers who frequently had occasion to 
coyer decorations on wood, especially 
aquarelle painting, with a polish, a good 
coating of fine white varnish is the first 
aecessity, dammar varnish being em- 
ployed for this purpose. This coat is 
primarily necessary as a protective layer 
so as to preserve the painted work from 
destructive attacks (Turing the rubbing

boose a white, dense, fine grained wood 
,?hich must present t a _ well-smoothed 
surface before the painting. After the 
painting the surface is faintly coated with 
a fine, quickly drying, limpid varnish 
When the coating has dried well, it [ s 
carefully rubbed down with finely pulver- 
ized pumice stone, with tallow or white 
lard, and now this surface is polished in 
the usual manner with a good solution 
prepared from the best white shellac. . 

Polishing Mediums. — For iron and 
steel, stannic oxide or Vienna lime or 
iron oxide and sometimes steel powder 
is employed. In using the burnisher, 
first oil is taken, then soap water, and 
next Vienna lime. 

For copper, brass, German silver, and 
tombac, stearine oil and Vienna lime 
are used. Articles^ of brass can be pol- 
ished, after the pickling, in the lathe 
with employment of a polish consisting 
of shellac, dissolved in alcohol, 1,000 
parts; powdered turmeric, 1,000 parts; 
tartar, 2,000 parts; ox gall, 50 parts; 
water, 3,000 parts. 

Gold is polished with ferric oxide 
(red stuff), which, moistened with alco- 
hol, is applied to leather. 

For polishing silver, the burnisher or 
bloodstone is employed, using soap 
water, thin beer, or a decoction of soap 
wort. Silver-plated articles are also 
polished with Vienna lime. 

Xo produce a dull luster on gold and 
silver ware, glass brushes, i. e., scratch 
brushes of finely spun glass threads, are 
made use of. . , 

Pewter articles arc polished W«J

Mending Porcelain by Riveting (see 
Adhesives for methods of mending Porcelain 
by means of cements). — Porcelain and glass 
can be readily pierced with steel tools. 
Best suited are hardened drills of ordinary 
shape, moistened with oil of turpentine, if 
the glazed or vitreous body is to be pierced. 
In the case of majolica and glass without 
enamel the purpose is best reached if the 
drilling is done under water. Thus, the 
vessel should previously be filled with 
water, and placed in a receptacle containing 
water, so that the drill is used under 
water, and, after piercing the clay body, 
reaches the water again. In the case of 
objects glazed on the inside, instead of 
filling them with water, the spot where 
the drill must come through may be 
underlaid with cork. The pressure 
with which the drill is worked is deter- 
mined by the hardness of the material, 
but when the tool is about to reach the 
other side it should gradually decrease 
and finally cease almost altogether, so as 
to avoid chipping. In order to enlarge, 
small bore holes already existing, three- 
cornered or four-square broaches, ground 
and polished, are best adapted. These 
are likewise employed under water or, 
if the material is too hard (glass or enam- 
el), moistened with oil of turpentine. 
The simultaneous use of oil of turpen- 
tine and water is most advisable m all 
eases even where the nature of the article 
to be pierced does not admit the use of 
oil alone, as in the. case of i raajobca and 
non-glazed porcelain, which absorb the 
oil without the use of water.

acidity of the fruit and is best made into 
a syrup with a little water and poured 
down through them. Peaches and pears 
after paring, are packed into the jars and 
a syrup of about a quarter of a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit poured over 
them. Most fruits need to be cooked

juice of a third as many currants and 
• u * a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. 



The flavor of all kinds of fruit is injured 
by cooking it long with the sugar, so 
heat the latter in the oven and add when 
the fruit is nearly done. 

Jelly is best made on a clear day, for 
small fruits absorb moisture, and if 
picked after a rain require longer boiling, 
and every minute of unnecessary boiling 
gives jelly a less delicate color and flavor. 
When jelly is syrupy, it has been boiled . 
too long; if it drops from the spoon with 
a spring, or wrinkles as you push it with 
the spoon in a saucer while cooling, it is 
done enough. Try it after 5 minutes' 
boil. Cook the fruit only until the skin 
is broken and pulp softened. Strain 
without squeezing for jelly, and use the 
last juice you squeeze out for jam. 
Measure the juice and boil uncovered, 
skimming off. For sweet fruits ^ of a 
pound of sugar is enough to a pint of 
juice. Heat the sugar in the oven, add 
to the boiling juice; stir till dissolved. 
When it boils up, draw to the back of the 
stove. Scald the jelly glasses, fill and 
let stand in a clean, cool place till next 
day; then cover. Blackberries make 
jelly of a delicious flavor and jelly easily 
when a little underripe. Currants should 
be barely ripe; the ends of the bunches 
may be rather green. . ,

t^Ip agitation without heat and a nner 
thus results, but its keeping qual- 
ity would be uncertain. 

tr —Fruit juices may be preserved by 
gentle heating and after protection from 
the air in sterilized containers lhe 
heat required is much below the boiling 
point. Professor Mul cr finds that a 
temperature of from 140° to 158 
maintained for 15 minutes, is sufficient 
to render the fermenting agents present 
inactive. The. bottles must also be 
heated to destroy any adherent germs. 
The juices may be placed m them as ex- 
pressed and the container then placed m 
a water bath. As soon as the heating is 
finished the bottles must be securely 
closed. The heating process will, in 
consequence of coagulating certain sub- 
stances, produce turbidity, and if clear 
liquid is required, filtration is, of course, 
necessary. In this case it is better to 
heat the juice in bulk in a kettle, filter 
through felt, fill the bottles, and then 
heat again in the containers as in the 
first instance. It is said that grape 
juice prepared in this manner has been 
found unaltered after keeping for many 
years. Various antiseptics have been 
proposed as preservatives for fruit juices 
and other articles of food, but all such 
agents are objectionable both on ac- 
count of their direct action on the system 
and their effect in rendering food less 
digestible. While small quantities of 
such drugs occasionally taken may exert 
no appreciable effect, continuous use is 
liable to be more or less harmful.

Rasoberry Juice— A dark juice 
obSafd bVaJding to the crushed rasp- 
beSes before the fermentation, slight 
nuantities of sugar in layers. The 
Calcohol forming during the fermen- 
Stion is said to cause a better extraction 
of the raspberry red. Furthermore, 
tLe boiling should not be conducted on 
a naked fire, but by means of super- 
heated steam, so as to avoid formation ot 
caramel. Finally, the sugar used should 
be perfectly free from ultramarine and 
lime, since both impurities detract from 
the red color of the raspberries.

Sjwlienies^ Carefully remove the 
I and calyxes, place the strawber- 



about in a tub of water for a few mo- 
ments, to remove any dirt clinging to 
them. Drain and partially dry spon- 
taneously, then remove from the sieve 
and put into a porcelain-lined kettle 
provided with a tight cover. To every 
pound of berries take a half pound of 
sugar and 2 ounces of water and put the 
same in a kettle over the fire. Let re- 
main until the sugar has dissolved or 
become liquid, and then pour the same, 
while still not, over the berries, cover the 
kettle tightly and let it stand overnight. 
The next morning put the kettle over the 
fire, removing the cover when the berries 
begin to boil, and let boil gently for 6 
to 8 minutes (according to the mass), 
removing all scum as it arises. Remove 
from the fire, and with a perforated 
spoon or dipper take the fruit from the 
syrup, and fill into any suitable vessel. 
Replace the syrup on the fire and boil for 
about the same length of time as before, 
then pour, all hot, over the berries. The 
next day empty out the contents of the 
vessel on a sieve, and let the berries 
drain off; remove the syrup that drains 
off, add water, put on the fire and boil 
until you obtain a syrup which flows but 
slowly from the stirring spoon. At this 
point add the berries, and let boil gently 
for a few moments. Have your pre- 
serve jars as hot as possible, -by putting 
them into a pot of cold water and bring- 
ing the latter to a boil, and into .them fill 
th! berries, hot from the kettle. Cool 
down cover with buttered paper, and 
^mediately close the jar. hermeUc^j-
